Install the shared PIE content stylesheet from the player instead of requiring hosts to import it.

`@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` holds classes that authored content depends on but no component owns: passage markup (`.numbered-paragraph`, `.p-number`, `div.passage-title`), the legacy `kds-*` families, and the `pie-answer-eliminator-*` styles. `PieItemPlayer.svelte` already imported that stylesheet, but in this package's Vite library build a plain CSS import is extracted to `dist/assets/pie-item-player.css` — a file nothing loads at runtime and no `exports` entry exposes. The import was a silent no-op, so hosts rendered authored passages unstyled unless they happened to import the stylesheet themselves, which was documented nowhere.

`@pie-players/pie-item-player` now inlines the stylesheet as text (`?raw`) and installs it once per document at import time, alongside custom-element registration, so it is in place before any instance renders. The separately importable session-debugger entry installs it too. The orphaned `dist/assets/pie-item-player.css` is no longer emitted. `@pie-players/pie-section-player` and `@pie-players/pie-assessment-player` are covered transitively, since they render items through the item player.

The stylesheet is prepended to `<head>` and deliberately left unlayered, so host CSS that loads later still wins at equal specificity — the placement hosts were previously told to arrange by hand. A cascade layer would have been wrong here: unlayered author declarations beat all layered ones regardless of specificity, so a host reset as broad as `p { margin: 0 }` would have silently outranked `.numbered-paragraph { margin-left: 36px }`.

Hosts that want to own the stylesheet can set `<html data-pie-content-styles="host">` before the player script runs; the player then installs nothing and warns once if no content stylesheet turns out to be present. `components.css` declares `--pie-content-styles` on `:root` as the presence sentinel behind that check.

Upgrading hosts do not have to remove an existing `import "@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css"` for this release to be correct: installation is idempotent, and two matching copies render identically. But a host copy loads later than the installed one and therefore wins ties at equal specificity, so a host copy pinned to an older `@pie-players/pie-theme` would silently override newer player rules. Rather than leave that to be discovered, the players now log a one-time warning naming the redundant import when they detect a second copy in the document.

`@pie-players/pie-print-player` installs it the same way, from its `src/index.ts` entry. This player never told hosts to import the stylesheet at all, so it had no working route to these styles. The gap is worse than a cosmetic one here: `components.css` owns `@media print { .noprint, .kds-noprint { display: none } }`, so a missing copy did not just render authored passage markup unstyled — it printed content the author had marked as non-printing. Nothing in the package strips authored classes on the way through; `processMarkup` swaps only the interactive element tags and returns the surrounding markup verbatim, and `pie-print` renders into light DOM (`createRenderRoot()` returns `this`), so a document-level stylesheet is the only thing that can reach that content.

New in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`: `installContentStyles`, `contentStylesPresent`, `contentStylesOptedOut`, `auditContentStyles`, plus a narrow `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/ui/content-styles` export. Print player imports through that subpath rather than the package root, because players-shared declares `sideEffects: true` and print player externalizes nothing — the root barrel would have bundled all of players-shared into `print-player.js`.

Hosts that already import `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` need no change — installation is idempotent and a duplicate host copy simply wins on document order.
