Add an opt-in `nds-icons` flag so hosts can render the vendored `<nds-icon-button>` per environment. Enable it with the `nds-icons` attribute on a section-player element (`<pie-section-player-splitpane nds-icons={true}>`, and likewise on `-vertical`, `-tabbed`, and `-base`) or via `runtime.ndsIcons: true`. When on, the toolbar tool buttons, the calculator shell controls, the inline-TTS play/pause trigger, and the section scroll-hint render as NDS icon buttons; the flag flows through the toolkit runtime context. It defaults to off, so unless a host explicitly opts in these controls render as plain `<button>`s.
