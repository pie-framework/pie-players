**Breaking for capability packages.** `ToolSurfaceRenderResult.sync` takes the current render context: `sync?: (context: ToolSurfaceRenderContext) => void`.

It took no argument, so a registration had nothing to read but the context captured when it rendered. A host reconciles surface capabilities by `toolId` and calls `sync` rather than remounting — a `<video>` recreated mid-playback restarts the recording — so `sync` is the *only* path a re-resolve has to an element already on screen, and with a captured context it re-applied the values the host already had. Two live consequences: a signed alternate re-resolved to a different recording (a `signLang` parameter change, or a catalog registering after first paint) left the learner watching the previous one, and a host calling `updateAssessment(...)` mid-session left the annotation gateway wired to the previous coordinator. Both were silent.

Update a registration by reading the parameter instead of the closure:

```diff
-const applyProps = () => {
-  element.media = context.content;
+const applyProps = (current: ToolSurfaceRenderContext) => {
+  element.media = current.content;
 };
-applyProps();
+applyProps(context);
 return { element, sync: applyProps };
```

## Host surfaces a region capability can actually reach

`section-overlay` gated every capability on `decideToolPolicy`, whose candidates are seeded only from `tools.placement` — and placing an `activation: "region"` capability is a `tools.unplaceableActivation` error at `error` severity. A capability that is only ever a region was therefore unreachable on that surface in both directions, and the mechanism worked for exactly the one capability that motivated it, which also has a toolbar activation. Region capabilities are now gated on `decideFeaturePolicy`, matching the item-media surface; placement-driven ones keep the placement question, which is where their candidacy comes from.

`item-media` now awaits `ensureToolModuleLoaded` before mounting, so a capability registered through the documented lazy module-loader path renders instead of silently missing its element. This costs a capability that registers its element eagerly one microtask.

`requiresAuthoredContent` is resolvable only on a surface the host renders per item or per passage. `CatalogOwnerContext` names an item model or a passage and never a section, because a DRD resource pairs with content rather than with a container — so `section-overlay` now declines a capability declaring one, with a console warning, instead of mounting it with `content: undefined`. That is documented on the contract; `resolve` must also be synchronous and return JSON-serializable content, both of which hosts already relied on and neither of which was stated.

## Item media region lifecycle

Three fixes in `SectionItemCard`, all reachable by toggling an accommodation at runtime:

- **Losing the last grant destroys the region, and the mount effect treated a missing anchor as "nothing to do."** The capability's `destroy()` never ran, so a detached `<video>` kept playing audio, and its entry stayed in the mounted map — so the next grant found an "existing" mount that was no longer in the document and the region stayed blank for the rest of the session. It now tears down, matching what the section-overlay surface already did.
- **The region and its keyboard-focusable resize divider followed the grant count, not what mounted.** `renderSurface` returning `null` is a legitimate answer — a host that remapped the element tag through `toolTagMap` to one it never defined takes that path — which produced an empty 34% column with a handle dividing nothing. Both now follow the mounted count.
- **Both surface anchors are `display: contents`.** They were always-present elements generating their own box: the overlay anchor as a permanent flex item shifting `gap` and child-index selectors, the media anchor breaking any `height: 100%` chain between the region and the capability's element.

## Guarantee that was asserted but not enforced

`UNIVERSAL_SUPPORTS_PRESET`'s exclusion of content-dependent accommodations was a hardcoded `not.toContain("signLanguage")`, with a comment deferring the declaration-driven form to the step that has now landed. It reads `registry.getContentDependentSupportIds()`, which had no caller outside its own unit test, and a second assertion covers the other half: no packaged registration declares a content dependency, so a twelfth one could not pass by being invisible to the first check.

## PNP debugger

Region capabilities no longer get per-level placement toggles or an "all available tools" entry. Clicking one wrote config that fails `tools.unplaceableActivation` at `error` severity, and the "visible" marker beside it read a placement-scoped decision a region capability is never in — so it reported "not visible" while the capability was correctly rendering. Rows show `host surface (not placed)` and, for a content-dependent capability, what has to be authored, which is what `contentDependencyDescription` was added for.
