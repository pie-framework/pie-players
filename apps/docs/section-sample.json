Review: Henri Rousseau at the Salon, April 12, 1898 1 A collection of Henri Rousseau’s paintings is currently on display at the Salon. The collection can only be described as uninteresting, childish, and confusing.2 Rousseau, a tax collector, has not received any proper training, and it clearly shows.3 The world through Rousseau’s eyes lacks beauty and sense of realness. A painting of a gypsy asleep in the desert, painted in 1897, is a good example. Hands are larger than they should be, and figures seem to be paper cutouts rather than living, breathing people. Backdrops in the art fail to have any depth.4 One painting of a tiger in a storm, painted in 1891, shows a tiger that awkwardly looks as if it is standing on a leaf. The tiger’s white teeth and eyes make it look lifeless and boring. The jungle plants are bent over as if they were carelessly placed onto the canvas. Perhaps Rousseau intended for it to look like a storm, but instead it looks like the work of an artist lacking both experience and talent. One can quickly see that Rousseau has never set foot in a real jungle. In fact, he has never left France.5 Rousseau’s paintings should not be on any gallery wall unless it is inside a school for young children. Why this man continues to paint and show off his work is bewildering."
