    notes:
      - "Use severity=warn for intent that may not be fully implemented yet."
      - "Keep checks focused on user impact: accessibility, predictability, reversibility."
      - "Assertion operators: equals, contains, containsAny, containsAll, equalsOrdered, notEqualsOrdered, lengthGte, isNullOrEmpty, gte, exists, valueContains, range, greaterThan, lessThan, notEquals, notContains, in, maxViolations (axe)"

    spiritChecks:
      - "No keyboard traps; focus order is predictable."
      - "Controls have accessible names and visible focus indicators."
      - "High-contrast and font-size settings do not break layout."
