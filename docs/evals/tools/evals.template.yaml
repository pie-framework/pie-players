    notes:
      - "Keep steps focused on tool functionality, coordination, and accessibility."

    spiritChecks:
      - "Tool UI is clear and age-appropriate for target grade band."
      - "Tool interactions are intuitive and reversible."
      - "Tool state is visually obvious (open/closed, active/inactive)."
      - "Focus management is predictable when opening/closing tool."
      - "Tool does not interfere with assessment item interactions."
      - "Error states are helpful and non-blocking."
