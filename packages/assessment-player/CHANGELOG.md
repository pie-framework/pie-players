### Patch Changes

- 2d8ce6a: Give `pie-assessment-player-default` an interface locale.
  
  The adoption pass covered the item player, the section players and the toolkit,
  and left the assessment player out: it rendered its own section-to-section
  navigation from four English literals — "Section {n} of {total}", "No sections",
  "Back" and "Next" — and forwarded no locale to the section element it mounts, so a
  host that set one got translated section chrome inside an untranslated assessment
  frame.
  
  It now observes a `locale` attribute, resolves its own provider, and forwards the
  tag to the section element. Its own provider rather than a context read, because
  the navigation sits beside the section host rather than inside it, so there is no
  published toolkit context above it. The catalog gains
  `player.assessment.sectionPosition` and `player.assessment.noSections`; the two
  buttons take the `common.back` / `common.next` that already existed.
  
  Additive and default-English: with no `locale` the provider stays on `en-US` and
  the four strings render exactly what they rendered before, and the section element
  gets no `locale` attribute rather than an empty one, which it would otherwise try
  to resolve.
- 27284f8: Collapse six implementations that existed twice or more, with no public surface
  changes.
  
  **Media fragment enforcement.** `applyMediaFragment` writes a `#t=start,end` URI
  that browsers honour at neither bound reliably, so each consumer enforced the
  range itself — the signing region and recorded read-aloud audio holding two copies
  of the same seek-forward-once and stop-at-end pair, which is how one of them came
  to enforce only the end. `enforceMediaFragment` now owns the arithmetic and each
  consumer supplies what reaching the end means: the signing region pauses, while
  `playRecordedAudio` treats it as the clip finishing so the chunk sequence advances.
  The end bound is now watched on `timeupdate` as well as by poll, so it is checked
  at least as tightly as before in both consumers.
  
  **Tag-name helpers.** `print-player/src/tag-names.ts` was a copy of
  `players-shared/src/pie/tag-names.ts`, itself the exported owner, down to
  `toPrintHashedTag` — which exists in the owner *for print* and has no other caller.
  Both copies carried their own test file. Print now imports from
  `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/pie/tag-names`.
  
  **Backend config cloning.** The assessment player carried an 85-line field-aware
  `BackendConfig` cloner duplicating the section player's, for a type the item player
  owns; a newly nested field would have been cloned by one copy and shared by
  reference in the other. It only ever needed a plain deep clone, and `cloneDeep`
  already existed at `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/object`. The section player's
  field-aware helpers stay: its merge logic consumes the pieces individually.
  
  **Overwide content wrappers.** The image and table wrappers shared an identical
  `isInsidePieCustomElement` and near-identical wrap-and-parse bodies. Both now call
  one engine in `security/wrap-overwide.ts`, declaring only what differs — selector,
  wrapper tag and class, markup probe, and the accessible name, which is the real
  divergence between an `alt` and a `<caption>`.
  
  **Context text extraction.** `extractTextContent` ran three byte-identical
  traversals, one per level, each redeclaring `stripHtml`, the models normalization
  and the model walk. The traversal is now shared and each level declares only which
  fields it reads, so a new place text can hide is added once. Verified
  output-identical against the previous implementation across fifteen context shapes,
  including record-form `models` and every missing-config path.
  
  **Toolbar rendering.** Seven packaged capabilities inlined the same
  `renderToolbar` body, varying only in overlay surface, window geometry and whether
  the coordinator is re-handed on sync. That is why one rule — the shell title
  tracking the interface locale — landed in three different spellings across three
  files. They now call `renderOverlayToolbar`, which derives the catalog keys from
  `toolId` as all seven already did.
  
  **Section-player shells.** The three layout shells plus the kernel host shell each
  carried the same clamp bounds, `resolveConfiguredPx`, host-element walk,
  narrow-breakpoint clamp, content-max-width pair and `matchMedia` watch. All of that
  moves to `components/shared/section-player-shell-layout.svelte.ts`. Two things stay
  duplicated because the compiler requires it, and the module says so: the `props`
  map inside `<svelte:options customElement>` must be a statically analyzable object
  literal, and a component's `export function` declarations are what become
  custom-element methods.
  
  **SSML detection.** Polly sniffed for SSML twice with the same seven tags inline,
  and Google kept a private copy of the standard set. `BaseTTSProvider.detectSSML`
  now owns the standard elements and takes a provider's own vocabulary as an
  argument, which is the part that legitimately differs: `<amazon:effect>` and
  `<aws-*>` mean nothing to Google, and Google's list was missing none of the
  standard tags but Polly's was missing `<say-as>` and `<mark>` — so Polly now
  recognises two standard elements it previously treated as plain text.
  
  Covered by the existing suites plus the reflow, tabbed-layout and
  vertical-passage-layout Playwright specs, which exercise the shared narrow-layout
  watch at 320px and across stacked-collapse strategy switches.
- 7c9fb28: One canonical section session snapshot
  
  `SectionControllerSessionState` and the four assessment-session shapes now live in
  `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/types`, beside `AssessmentSection` and the
  delivery slices the snapshot carries. `pie-assessment-toolkit` and
  `pie-assessment-player` re-export them, so every existing import specifier keeps
  working.
  
  This replaces five byte-identical copies of a three-field `SectionSessionSnapshot`
  — one in `pie-assessment-player` and one in each of four demo apps — that declared
  `currentItemIndex`, `visitedItemIdentifiers` and `itemSessions` and omitted the
  `formative` and `timedMedia` slices. No data was lost at runtime: both
  `upsertSectionSession` implementations pass the snapshot through by reference. The
  cost was that the assessment layer could not read the slices it was already
  persisting without a cast, so a cross-section mastery rollup had no typed state to
  build on.
- 54742db: A second full-codebase review turned up more drift, duplication, and interface
  problems than the first sweep caught, concentrated in the TTS provider stack and
  the debugger-tool family. No public surface changes; behaviour fixes are called
  out explicitly.
  
  **TTS rate and pitch.** Polly and Google both advertised `supportsRate` /
  `supportsPitch` while never reading `request.rate` / `request.pitch` — a caller
  asking for a different speech rate got normal-speed audio with no error.
  `BaseTTSProvider.applyProsody` / `buildProsodyAttrs` now wrap plain-text requests
  in an SSML `<prosody>` envelope on both providers; already-SSML input is left
  alone. `pitch` follows this repo's existing 0-2 multiplier convention (the TTS
  settings UI's `normalizePitch`), converted to SSML's relative percentage form.
  
  **SchoolCity speech-mark timing.** `tts-client-server`'s custom-transport parser
  reimplemented SchoolCity's JSONL wire format from scratch, with none of the
  offset/time-unit corrections `SchoolCityServerProvider` applies — reproducing the
  mistiming bug that correction was built to fix. `normalizeSpeechMarks` moves to
  `tts-server-core` so both share one implementation.
  
  **TTS error-mapping granularity.** Polly collapsed every AWS SDK error to
  `PROVIDER_ERROR`; SchoolCity did the same for every HTTP failure. Both now map
  to `TEXT_TOO_LONG` / `INVALID_REQUEST` / `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` /
  `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` where the underlying exception name or HTTP status
  says so, matching the granularity Google already had. A documented consumer maps
  these four `TTSErrorCode` members onto HTTP responses, so Polly's
  `TextLengthExceededException` reaching `TEXT_TOO_LONG` is newly correct handling
  on a path that previously always fell through to a generic error.
  
  **Rate-to-speedRate bucketing.** `SchoolCityServerProvider` and
  `ServerTTSProvider` each bucketed a numeric rate into `slow`/`medium`/`fast`
  with different thresholds, disagreeing for rate 1.1-1.49.
  `resolveSpeedRateBucket` in `tts-server-core` is now the one implementation,
  on the server's deliberate 0.95-1.5 tolerance band.
  
  **Shadow-DOM-blind theme lookup.** `tool-color-scheme`'s host lookup called
  `closest('pie-theme')` from inside its own open shadow root, which
  `Element.closest()` can never cross — on any page with more than one
  independently-scoped `<pie-theme>` it silently always picked the wrong one.
  `resolvePieThemeHost` in `pie-theme` walks out through each shadow root's host
  to find the real ancestor. The same change adds `applyPieColorScheme` as the one
  canonical "resolve host, set scheme, persist" sequence, replacing both
  `tool-color-scheme`'s own copy and `apps/section-demos`' independently-drifted
  version.
  
  **Debugger-panel subscription lifecycle.** `EventPanel` and `SectionSessionPanel`
  each reimplemented the same subscribe/detach/resubscribe scaffolding;
  `SectionSessionPanel`'s read and wrote reactive state directly inside a tracked
  `$effect` body instead of wrapping it in `untrack()`, and its lifecycle handler
  always resubscribed instead of distinguishing the disposed and same-target cases
  `EventPanel` already handled. `createSectionControllerSubscriptionManager` in
  `section-player-tools-shared` is now shared by both. The same change wires
  `persistence-scope` / `persistence-panel-id` through for `PnpPanel` and
  `SectionSessionPanel`, which had neither despite `SharedFloatingPanel` supporting
  layout persistence and two sibling debuggers already exposing it.
  
  **Pointer-drag tracking.** `tool-line-reader` and `tool-text-to-speech` each
  hand-rolled identical pointer-capture drag-position tracking.
  `createPointerDragController` in `players-shared/ui` covers the shared position
  math; `tool-line-reader`'s separate resize handling stays where it is.
  
  **Custom-element registration.** `pie-print` bypassed its own package's guarded
  registry and called Lit's `@customElement` decorator directly, which throws an
  uncaught `NotSupportedError` on double-bundling where every other player
  no-ops. It now goes through the same guard. `defineCustomElementSafely`
  (players-shared) and print-player's registry also shared the same
  duplicate-define handling with different collision coverage; consolidated into
  one implementation, which incidentally fixes a latent bug where an
  already-registered tag not tracked locally hit a doomed wrapped-subclass retry
  instead of short-circuiting.
  
  **Everything else.** `coerceBooleanLike` had three different, disagreeing
  implementations across `section-player` and `assessment-player` for the same
  attribute-coercion job; unified in `players-shared`. `sanitize-item-markup` and
  `sanitize-svg-icon`'s DOMPurify forbid-lists had drifted despite a comment
  claiming parity; now share one list. `AssessmentPlayerDefaultElement` swallowed
  TTS teardown errors in empty catch blocks instead of reporting them through
  `ToolkitCoordinator.reportFrameworkError`. `item-player`'s `"player-error"` event
  now has an exported constant matching the pattern `section-player` and
  `assessment-player` already use (no wire-value change).
- f2c1dfb: Keep keyboard focus and announce the new position when the learner changes section.
  
  `render()` rebuilds the player's whole subtree on a route change, so the control the
  learner had just activated was destroyed and the browser dropped focus to `<body>`.
  Their next Tab restarted at the top of the document — past the host's chrome and the
  accommodations tool bar — and a screen reader announced nothing at all, because the
  visible "Section 2 of 3" indicator is not a live region and the section landmark had
  no name.
  
  Focus now returns to the control it was on. A control the change disables cannot hold
  focus — pressing Back into the first section is exactly when that happens — so the
  intent degrades to the other navigation button and then to the section region, which
  carries `tabindex="-1"` and a `role="region"` named for the current position. No
  branch can end with focus on `<body>`.
  
  Only focus this element already owned is repaired. A host that drives navigation
  programmatically may have the learner's focus in its own chrome or another form, and
  pulling focus in from outside would be worse than the bug being fixed; those cases
  get the announcement without the focus move.
  
  The announcement comes from a polite `role="status"` region created once and kept out
  of the render swap, since a live region only announces changes that happen while it is
  already in the document. It is empty on load — announcing the starting position would
  be noise.
  
  `packages/section-player` needs no equivalent: both shipped layouts render every item
  in the section at once, so item selection moves a marker rather than swapping a view,
  and focus was verified to survive it.
  
  Covered by four tests in `assessment-player-smoke.spec.ts`. The existing keyboard test
  there asserted focus only *before* pressing Enter, and explicitly refocused first,
  which is why it never caught this.

### Patch Changes

- 26dbea3: PIE-501: harden element loading during section-player section swaps.

  Pre-1.0 lockstep release: every package in the `fixed` block bumps
  together at release time per the project versioning policy. Per pre-1.0
  semver convention every release is a patch bump, even when behavior
  changes are breaking — the breaking changes inventory below is for
  host migration, not for the version bump level. PIE-501
  investigation traced sporadic post-section-swap render failures
  (`Preloaded strategy requires pre-registered elements; missing tags:
…`) to two coupled root causes — a non-truthful element-load promise
  contract, and the section-player rewriting embedded items' loading
  strategy and tracking readiness through cached state. Fixing those
  unblocked a broader architecture-review compat-removal sweep that had
  been gated on the same surfaces.

  This release ships both phases of the PIE-501 plan plus the
  compat-removal work that fell out of the same review. None of the
  removed surfaces are part of the `pie-item` client contract (the only
  allowed compatibility surface per
  `.cursor/rules/legacy-compatibility-boundaries.mdc`).

  ## What's new

  - **Deep `ElementLoader` primitive** (PIE-501 Phase A). A single loader
    primitive whose promise resolves only when every requested custom-
    element tag is actually registered, and rejects with a per-tag
    reason otherwise. Both IIFE and ESM are now adapters over this
    primitive. Replaces the previous parallel `IifeLoader` / `EsmLoader`
    classes in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`. The deep primitive is
    the shipped contract; the strategy name (`iife` / `esm` / `preloaded`)
    selects an adapter rather than a parallel implementation.

  - **Strategy substitution removed** (PIE-501 Phase B). Embedded
    item-players inherit the host's chosen strategy verbatim. The
    section-player still pre-warms the aggregate element set for
    performance but no longer owns correctness through cached state;
    widget readiness is now a function of inputs. The
    `allowPreloadedFallbackLoad` escape hatch is gone.

  - **M5 — strict two-tier mirror rule.** Tier-1 layout-CE props mirror
    to `runtime.*` keys with documented precedence; the resolver enforces
    the mirror per-key.

  - **M6 — canonical stage vocabulary.** `pie-stage-change` (`composed`,
    `engine-ready`, `interactive`, `disposed`) and `pie-loading-complete`
    are the canonical readiness surface, with a toolkit-side stage
    tracker and `onStageChange` / `onLoadingComplete` props on the layout
    CEs.

  - **M7 — `SectionRuntimeEngine`.** A single FSM-driven runtime engine
    consolidates section-controller lifecycle, readiness derivation, and
    stage emissions previously scattered across multiple coordinators.

  - **M8 — tool policy engine.** Allow/block + PNP/profile enforcement become a
    first-class policy surface on `ToolkitCoordinator`
    (`onPolicyChange`, `decideToolPolicy`, `updateToolPlacement`,
    `setPnpEnforcement`, `registerPolicySource`), with narrow profile
    auto-detection mirrored through `runtime.tools.pnpEnforcement`.

  - **`FrameworkErrorBus` contract.** A single canonical
    `framework-error` source, single subscription via
    `onFrameworkError(model: FrameworkErrorModel)`, and the layout-CE
    host emits exactly one `framework-error` per error (the previous
    toolkit-bubble + engine-bridge dual-emit is collapsed — see Removed).

  - **Tabbed section-player layout.** New `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`
    CE alongside the existing splitpane and vertical layouts.

  ## Removed (breaking)

  - **Deprecated `AssessmentToolkitEvents` event-map and member event
    interfaces** (`AssessmentStartedEvent`, `AssessmentCompletedEvent`,
    `AssessmentPausedEvent`, `AssessmentResumedEvent`,
    `CanNavigateChangedEvent`, `InteractionEvent`, `InteractionType`,
    `ItemChangedEvent`, `ItemMetadata`, `LoadCompleteEvent`,
    `LocaleChangedEvent`, `LocaleLoadingCompleteEvent`,
    `LocaleLoadingErrorEvent`, `LocaleLoadingStartEvent`,
    `NavigationRequestEvent`, `PlayerErrorEvent`, `SessionChangedEvent`,
    `StateRestoredEvent`, `StateSavedEvent`, `SyncFailedEvent`,
    `ToolActivatedEvent`, `ToolDeactivatedEvent`,
    `ToolStateChangedEvent`). They were aspirational and never emitted
    from any production path. The canonical replacement surfaces
    (DOM `CustomEvent`s on `<pie-assessment-toolkit>`,
    `ToolkitCoordinator.subscribe*` helpers, and the M3
    framework-error contract) are unchanged.

  - **Deprecated Svelte-store-shaped `toolCoordinatorStore`** and the
    prior `ToolCoordinator` _interface_ (the z-index / visibility shape
    in `packages/assessment-toolkit/src/tools/types.ts`, with
    `registerTool` / `showTool` / `hideTool` / `toggleTool` /
    `bringToFront` / `updateToolElement` / `hideAllTools` /
    `getToolState` / `isToolVisible`). The canonical replacement is the
    class-based `ToolCoordinator` (typed by `ToolCoordinatorApi` in
    `packages/assessment-toolkit/src/services/interfaces.ts`)
    re-exported from `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit` and
    instantiated by `ToolkitCoordinator` as `coordinator.toolCoordinator`.
    All instance methods carry over verbatim, plus a `subscribe()` for
    reactive consumption that replaces the deleted Svelte-store derived
    views. Independently, `ToolkitCoordinator`'s tool-policy surface
    (`onPolicyChange`, `decideToolPolicy`, `updateToolPlacement`,
    `setPnpEnforcement`, `registerPolicySource`) is the canonical entry
    point for the _tool policy_ concern (allow/block + PNP/profile enforcement)
    — that is a different concern than the floating-tool z-index API
    the deleted interface served.

  - **Top-level `createSectionController` prop on every section-player
    layout custom element** (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-vertical>`, `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`,
    `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`, `<pie-section-player-base>`)
    and the corresponding kernel pass-through. The factory is now
    exposed only via `runtime.createSectionController`, the canonical
    M5 entry point.

    Note: `<pie-assessment-toolkit>`'s `createSectionController` prop
    is **unchanged** — the toolkit accepts it directly as part of its
    composition surface.

  - **Top-level `isolation` prop on every section-player layout custom
    element** (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-vertical>`, `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`,
    `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`, `<pie-section-player-base>`)
    and the corresponding kernel pass-through. The isolation strategy
    is now read only from `runtime.isolation`; when omitted, the
    resolver falls back to the package default (`DEFAULT_ISOLATION`).

    Note: the toolkit's `<pie-assessment-toolkit>` keeps `isolation` as a
    JS-only object property (see the toolkit-side carve-out below), but
    the kebab-attribute (`isolation="…"` HTML form) was also removed in
    this sweep. Layout-CE hosts must use `runtime.isolation`; standalone
    toolkit hosts must assign `el.isolation = …` programmatically.

  - **Top-level `item-toolbar-tools` / `passage-toolbar-tools`
    attribute aliases (and their `itemToolbarTools` / `passageToolbarTools`
    prop forms) on every section-player layout custom element**
    (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`, `<pie-section-player-vertical>`,
    `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`, `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`),
    along with the matching one-time deprecation warnings and the
    `parseToolList(itemToolbarTools)` / `parseToolList(passageToolbarTools)`
    absorption inside `resolveToolsConfig`. Per-region tool placement is
    now configured directly on the canonical `tools` object as
    `tools.placement.item` / `tools.placement.passage` (or via
    `runtime.tools.placement.{item,passage}`).

    The kernel re-exposes the canonical placement arrays as
    comma-separated strings via slot props (`itemToolbarTools`,
    `passageToolbarTools`) so internal card / pane custom elements
    (`<pie-section-player-item-card>`, `<pie-section-player-passage-card>`,
    `<pie-section-player-items-pane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-passages-pane>`) keep their existing
    string-attribute contract unchanged.

  - **Deprecated readiness DOM-event aliases on every section-player
    layout custom element** — `readiness-change`, `interaction-ready`,
    and `ready` — along with the engine's `legacy-event-bridge` that
    emitted them, the corresponding `SectionEngineOutput` kinds
    (`readiness-change`, `interaction-ready`, `ready`), the engine
    state fields that gated them (`interactionReadyEmitted`,
    `readyEmitted`, `lastReadinessDetail`), the
    `pie-section-readiness-change` / `pie-section-interaction-ready` /
    `pie-section-ready` instrumentation mappings, and the
    `readinessChange` / `interactionReady` / `ready` entries on
    `SECTION_PLAYER_PUBLIC_EVENTS`. Hosts now consume the canonical
    M6 vocabulary directly:

    - `readiness-change` → `pie-stage-change` (the readiness payload
      is also reachable via the layout CE's `selectReadiness()` /
      `getSnapshot().readiness`).
    - `interaction-ready` → `pie-stage-change` filtered on
      `detail.stage === "interactive"`.
    - `ready` → `pie-loading-complete`.

  - **Deprecated `section-controller-ready` Svelte/DOM event** — the
    kernel-side `dispatch("section-controller-ready", ...)` call,
    the matching `on:section-controller-ready={…}` forwarders on every
    layout CE wrapper (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-vertical>`, `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`,
    `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`), the
    `sectionControllerReady` entry on `SECTION_PLAYER_PUBLIC_EVENTS`,
    the `SectionPlayerControllerReadyDetail` type export, and the
    `pie-section-controller-ready` instrumentation mapping in
    `SECTION_INSTRUMENTATION_EVENT_MAP`. The kernel still feeds the
    engine FSM's `section-controller-resolved` input on first
    resolution per cohort (canonical stage progression
    `booting-section → engine-ready`); only the kernel-level Svelte
    event and its DOM-forwarded layout-host emit are gone. The
    toolkit-internal `pie-toolkit-section-controller-ready`
    telemetry name is unchanged. Migration:

    - Pull a controller handle directly:
      `await el.waitForSectionController(timeoutMs)` or
      `el.getSectionController()` on the layout CE.
    - Or filter `pie-stage-change` for
      `detail.stage === "engine-ready"` and then call
      `el.getSectionController()`.

  - **`autoFocusFirstItem` boolean alias on
    `SectionPlayerFocusPolicy`** and the runtime translation logic that
    mapped it onto the canonical `autoFocus` enum (along with its
    one-time deprecation warning). Hosts now set `autoFocus` directly:

    ```ts
    // before
    el.policies = { focus: { autoFocusFirstItem: true } };
    // after
    el.policies = { focus: { autoFocus: "start-of-content" } };
    // (or `"none"` to disable)
    ```

    The two Playwright tests that pinned the deprecated alias contract
    (`section-player-navigation-contract.spec.ts`) are removed.

  - **Orphaned `runtime-event-guards.ts` re-export shim** in
    `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit` (`@deprecated since M7`,
    `createRuntimeId` is the only re-export). Import from
    `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit/runtime/internal` instead.

  - **`one-time warning utility` deprecation-warning utility** and its
    public re-export from `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit`
    (`packages/assessment-toolkit/src/services/deprecation-warnings.ts`,
    along with the test-only `test reset helper` and the
    `one-time warning utility` test block in
    `tests/framework-error-bus.test.ts`). Every internal callsite
    was removed earlier in this sweep; no in-tree code depends on the
    utility. External consumers that imported it from the package
    root should inline a per-callsite `console.warn` (the utility
    was a thin once-per-label, dev-only `console.warn` wrapper).

  - **Toolkit `isolation` kebab-attribute surface on
    `<pie-assessment-toolkit>`.** The `isolation` prop is now a
    JS-only object property (`type: "Object", reflect: false`); the
    previously observed `isolation="…"` HTML attribute is no longer
    parsed. Hosts that set isolation declaratively must move to a
    property assignment (or set it via `runtime.isolation` on the
    enclosing layout CE):

    ```html
    <!-- before -->
    <pie-assessment-toolkit isolation="shadow"></pie-assessment-toolkit>
    ```

    ```ts
    // after
    el.isolation = "shadow";
    ```

  - **Removed `ToolkitCoordinatorHooks` error hooks**
    (`onError`, `onTTSError`, `onProviderError`) and their
    subscription/dispatch logic on `ToolkitCoordinator`, plus the
    internal helpers (`toCauseError`, `contextFromFrameworkErrorModel`,
    `providerIdFromSource`) that synthesized the prior
    `(error, context)` payload from the canonical
    `FrameworkErrorModel`. The single canonical hook is
    `onFrameworkError(model: FrameworkErrorModel)`, which already
    delivers every `framework-error` exactly once per error
    (filterable on `model.kind`). Migration:

    ```ts
    // before
    coordinator.setHooks({
      onError: (error, context) => log({ error, context }),
      onTTSError: (error) => bumpTtsErrorCount(),
      onProviderError: (error, context) => log(context.providerId, error),
    });

    // after
    coordinator.setHooks({
      onFrameworkError: (model) => {
        // model.kind: "tool-config" | "runtime-init" | "runtime-dispose"
        //           | "coordinator-init" | "provider-init" | "provider-register"
        //           | "tts-init" | "tool-state-load" | "tool-state-save"
        //           | "section-controller-init" | "section-controller-dispose"
        //           | "unknown"
        // model.severity, model.source, model.message, model.details,
        // model.recoverable, model.cause, …
        log(model);
        if (model.kind === "tts-init") bumpTtsErrorCount();
      },
    });
    ```

  - **`framework-error` dual-emit on the layout CE host.** Previously,
    while a `<pie-assessment-toolkit>` was nested inside a layout CE,
    the layout host received **two** `framework-error` DOM events per
    error (one engine-bridge emit on the layout host plus the bubbled
    toolkit emit). The dual-emit is collapsed to a single canonical
    emit: the kernel's `handleFrameworkError` listener at
    `<pie-section-player-base>` now calls `event.stopPropagation()`
    after re-feeding the engine, so the bubbled toolkit emit no
    longer reaches the layout CE host. Outside listeners on the layout
    host now see exactly one `framework-error` per error — the
    engine-bridge emit (target = layout host, non-bubbling,
    non-composed). Direct listeners attached to
    `<pie-assessment-toolkit>` itself are unaffected (the toolkit
    dispatch reaches them before the kernel listener runs). The
    `onFrameworkError` callback prop and the package-internal
    `FrameworkErrorBus` are unchanged — both were already single-fire.
    The single-emit contract is now pinned by
    `packages/section-player/tests/section-player-framework-error-dual-emit.test.ts`
    (the file name is preserved for git blame; the test now asserts
    the single canonical emit).

  - **`allowPreloadedFallbackLoad` escape hatch.** Removed alongside the
    PIE-501 Phase B strategy-substitution work. Hosts that relied on it
    to mask preload-misses should ensure their preload set is correct
    (the `ElementLoader` primitive now rejects deterministically with a
    per-tag reason if a requested tag never registers).

  - **Per-strategy loader classes** (`IifeLoader`, `EsmLoader` and their
    test fixtures) in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`. Replaced by the
    deep `ElementLoader` primitive plus IIFE / ESM adapters. Hosts that
    imported the loader classes directly should switch to
    `ElementLoader`; hosts that only used the public
    `<pie-item-player>` / `<pie-section-player-*>` attribute surface
    need no change.

  ## Migration

  ```ts
  // before
  const el = document.createElement("pie-section-player-splitpane");
  el.createSectionController = () => new SectionController();
  el.isolation = "shadow";
  el.setAttribute("item-toolbar-tools", "calculator,answer-eliminator");
  el.setAttribute("passage-toolbar-tools", "line-reader");

  // after
  el.runtime = {
    createSectionController: () => new SectionController(),
    isolation: "shadow",
    tools: {
      placement: {
        item: ["calculator", "answer-eliminator"],
        passage: ["line-reader"],
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Section-controller resolution (replaces `section-controller-ready`):

  ```ts
  // before
  el.addEventListener("section-controller-ready", (event) => {
    const { controller } = (event as CustomEvent).detail;
    // …
  });

  // after — pull-style (preferred for one-shot consumers)
  const controller = await(
    el as HTMLElement & {
      waitForSectionController?: (timeoutMs?: number) => Promise<unknown>;
    }
  ).waitForSectionController?.(5000);

  // after — event-driven
  el.addEventListener("pie-stage-change", (event) => {
    const { stage } = (event as CustomEvent).detail;
    if (stage !== "engine-ready") return;
    const controller = (
      el as HTMLElement & { getSectionController?: () => unknown }
    ).getSectionController?.();
    // …
  });
  ```

  `AssessmentToolkitEvents` consumers should subscribe to the canonical
  DOM events / coordinator helpers instead. The Svelte-store coordinator
  had no in-tree consumers; hosts that imported it should switch to the
  class-based `ToolCoordinator` reachable via
  `coordinator.toolCoordinator` on `ToolkitCoordinator` (same method
  shape — `registerTool`, `showTool`, `hideTool`, `toggleTool`,
  `bringToFront`, `updateToolElement`, `hideAllTools`, `getToolState`,
  `isToolVisible` — plus `subscribe(listener)` for reactive consumers
  that previously relied on the Svelte-store derived views).

  ```ts
  // before
  el.addEventListener("readiness-change", (event) => {
    // event.detail: EngineReadinessDetail
  });
  el.addEventListener("interaction-ready", () => {
    // gate "start test" UI
  });
  el.addEventListener("ready", () => {
    // all items loaded
  });

  // after
  import type { StageChangeDetail } from "@pie-players/pie-players-shared/pie";
  import type { EngineReadinessDetail } from "@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit/runtime/internal";

  el.addEventListener("pie-stage-change", (event) => {
    const { stage } = (event as CustomEvent<StageChangeDetail>).detail;
    // stage: "composed" | "engine-ready" | "interactive" | "disposed"
    if (stage === "interactive") {
      // gate "start test" UI
    }
  });
  el.addEventListener("pie-loading-complete", () => {
    // all items loaded (single-shot, cohort-scoped)
  });
  // Readiness payload (formerly the `readiness-change` detail) is also
  // reachable on demand:
  const readiness: EngineReadinessDetail | undefined = el.selectReadiness?.();
  ```

  Hosts that previously de-duplicated `framework-error` listeners on the
  layout CE host (because the same logical error arrived twice — once
  bubbled from the toolkit, once from the engine bridge) can drop that
  de-dup logic: the layout host now fires `framework-error` exactly once
  per error. The canonical `onFrameworkError` callback prop and the
  package-internal `FrameworkErrorBus` were already single-fire and need
  no migration.
