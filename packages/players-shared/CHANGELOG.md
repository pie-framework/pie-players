# @pie-players/pie-players-shared

## 0.3.62

### Patch Changes

- 14666b3: Install the shared PIE content stylesheet from the player instead of requiring hosts to import it.

  `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` holds classes that authored content depends on but no component owns: passage markup (`.numbered-paragraph`, `.p-number`, `div.passage-title`), the legacy `kds-*` families, and the `pie-answer-eliminator-*` styles. `PieItemPlayer.svelte` already imported that stylesheet, but in this package's Vite library build a plain CSS import is extracted to `dist/assets/pie-item-player.css` — a file nothing loads at runtime and no `exports` entry exposes. The import was a silent no-op, so hosts rendered authored passages unstyled unless they happened to import the stylesheet themselves, which was documented nowhere.

  `@pie-players/pie-item-player` now inlines the stylesheet as text (`?raw`) and installs it once per document at import time, alongside custom-element registration, so it is in place before any instance renders. The separately importable session-debugger entry installs it too. The orphaned `dist/assets/pie-item-player.css` is no longer emitted. `@pie-players/pie-section-player` and `@pie-players/pie-assessment-player` are covered transitively, since they render items through the item player.

  The stylesheet is prepended to `<head>` and deliberately left unlayered, so host CSS that loads later still wins at equal specificity — the placement hosts were previously told to arrange by hand. A cascade layer would have been wrong here: unlayered author declarations beat all layered ones regardless of specificity, so a host reset as broad as `p { margin: 0 }` would have silently outranked `.numbered-paragraph { margin-left: 36px }`.

  Hosts that want to own the stylesheet can set `<html data-pie-content-styles="host">` before the player script runs; the player then installs nothing and warns once if no content stylesheet turns out to be present. `components.css` declares `--pie-content-styles` on `:root` as the presence sentinel behind that check.

  Upgrading hosts do not have to remove an existing `import "@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css"` for this release to be correct: installation is idempotent, and two matching copies render identically. But a host copy loads later than the installed one and therefore wins ties at equal specificity, so a host copy pinned to an older `@pie-players/pie-theme` would silently override newer player rules. Rather than leave that to be discovered, the players now log a one-time warning naming the redundant import when they detect a second copy in the document.

  `@pie-players/pie-print-player` installs it the same way, from its `src/index.ts` entry. This player never told hosts to import the stylesheet at all, so it had no working route to these styles. The gap is worse than a cosmetic one here: `components.css` owns `@media print { .noprint, .kds-noprint { display: none } }`, so a missing copy did not just render authored passage markup unstyled — it printed content the author had marked as non-printing. Nothing in the package strips authored classes on the way through; `processMarkup` swaps only the interactive element tags and returns the surrounding markup verbatim, and `pie-print` renders into light DOM (`createRenderRoot()` returns `this`), so a document-level stylesheet is the only thing that can reach that content.

  New in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`: `installContentStyles`, `contentStylesPresent`, `contentStylesOptedOut`, `auditContentStyles`, plus a narrow `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/ui/content-styles` export. Print player imports through that subpath rather than the package root, because players-shared declares `sideEffects: true` and print player externalizes nothing — the root barrel would have bundled all of players-shared into `print-player.js`.

  Hosts that already import `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` need no change — installation is idempotent and a duplicate host copy simply wins on document order.

- 001486e: Preserve authored attributes and children through the print tag swap, and sanitize print markup by default.

  `processMarkup` previously carried only `id`, `pie-id`, and `data-original-tag` onto the freshly built print element, so everything else authored on that element was silently dropped:

  - `class`, `style`, `lang`, `dir`, `aria-*`, and `data-*` were lost. An item authored as `<multiple-choice id="1" class="noprint">` lost its print-suppression hook and printed anyway on hosts that load `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css`.
  - Child nodes were lost, discarding authored fallback content and destroying nested interactive elements — a nested element could even be reported in the returned node list while being absent from the returned markup.

  All attributes are now copied and children are moved across. `id`, `pie-id`, and `data-original-tag` are still set by the processor so they win over any authored value of the same name.

  `<pie-print>` now also sanitizes authored `item.markup` through `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/security` by default, matching `<pie-item-player>`. Hosts can opt out with the `trust-markup` attribute or supply their own sanitizer via the `sanitizeMarkup` property. The interactive element tags from `item.elements` and their hashed print variants are allow-listed so sanitizing does not strip them.

  `sanitizeItemMarkup` gains a `wrapOverwideContent` option (default `true`, unchanged for the screen players). The print player passes `false`: the overwide image/table wrappers are `overflow-x: auto` reflow affordances with no `@media print` override, and `overflow` clips rather than scrolls in print media, so wide images and tables would be cut off.

  Also drops the `static styles` block from `PiePrint`. It declared a `:host` border, padding and `max-width`, none of which ever applied: `createRenderRoot()` returns `this` for light-DOM rendering, so Lit never calls `adoptStyles`. Removing dead declarations, no rendered change.

- 6a18f3c: Scope external stylesheets with an at-rule-aware walker, so `@media`, `@supports` and `:root` survive.

  `pie-item-player` scoped external stylesheets by prefixing every selector-like fragment with
  one regex. That is correct for flat selector rules and wrong for everything else:
  `@media screen { ... }` became `.pie-item-player.x @media screen { ... }`, an invalid
  selector, so the browser dropped the whole block and every rule inside it. `@font-face` and
  `@keyframes` were corrupted the same way — the font never loaded, the animation name was
  gone. And `:root { --var: ... }` became `.pie-item-player.x :root`, which can never match,
  because `:root` is `<html>` and is not a descendant of the player.

  At-rules and `:root` custom properties therefore never applied at all. Both entry paths were
  affected: the `external-style-urls` attribute and `itemConfig.resources.stylesheets[*].url`.

  Scoping now walks the stylesheet brace-by-brace, in a new `scopeStylesheetCss` export from
  `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`:

  - `@media`, `@supports`, `@container`, `@layer` and `@scope` keep their prelude and have
    their inner rules scoped, recursively.
  - `@font-face`, `@keyframes` (including vendor-prefixed), `@page`, `@property` and
    `@counter-style` pass through untouched, as do at-rules the walker does not recognise —
    their blocks hold declarations or keyframe selectors, not selectors to scope.
  - `:root`, `html` and `body` are replaced by the scope selector instead of being prefixed by
    it, so external custom properties apply. Anything that followed is preserved:
    `html.dark .a` becomes `.pie-item-player.x.dark .a`.
  - A leading pseudo becomes a descendant: `:is(.a, .b) .c` scopes to
    `.pie-item-player.x :is(.a, .b) .c`, not `.pie-item-player.x:is(.a, .b) .c`, which would
    demand that the player root carry the partner's class.
  - Parsing is string- and paren-aware, so a `{` inside `content: "{"` does not end a block and
    a `,` inside `:is(a, b)` does not split a selector list. Comments are stripped before the
    walk so one sitting between two rules is not absorbed into the next selector.
  - Style-rule blocks are emitted verbatim, which is also what native CSS nesting needs:
    nested selectors are relative to a parent that has already been scoped.

  Flat selector rules scope exactly as before. No new dependency, and no public API change —
  no new attribute, prop or event.

  **Where stylesheets are passed, expect visible changes.** At-rules and `:root` variables have
  never applied in this player, so fixing the scoper turns currently-dead CSS live. That is the
  point of the fix, but it is a real rendering difference for any host that was passing a
  stylesheet with media queries or custom properties in it.

  `@import` still passes through untouched, exactly as the regex left it. It pulls in an
  unscoped stylesheet and so defeats scoping; blocking it is a policy decision, not a scoping
  one. Cross-origin stylesheets are also still unscoped — they take the `<link>` branch because
  `fetch()` cannot read the text to rewrite. Both are pre-existing and tracked separately.

## 0.3.59

## 0.3.58

### Patch Changes

- 8df52bf: Add an opt-in allow-list for executable element packages. The default policy mode requires exact versions without build metadata so legacy IIFE bundle separators cannot be injected. Existing hosts that omit the policy retain their current loading behavior.
- d5cc905: Preserve distinct full custom-element tags when multiple PIE element versions coexist, while keeping the established tag encoder and existing single-version behavior unchanged. Legacy IIFE bundles now reject unrepresentable maps containing multiple specs for one package instead of aliasing distinct tags to one constructor.

### Patch Changes

- 0c20d0f: Fix PIE-631: EBSR (and any element with `lockChoiceOrder: false`) no longer triggers an infinite render loop. A controller's persisted derived state (e.g. shuffled choice order) now round-trips back into the authoritative item session via a new `ItemController.mergeElementSession` and an `onElementSessionUpdate` callback on `updatePieElements`, so the order is reused across renders instead of being regenerated non-deterministically each cycle.

## 0.3.39

### Patch Changes

- 0072fad: Move Svelte out of published runtime dependencies and add a release check that rejects future accidental `svelte` runtime dependency declarations.

## 0.3.38

### Patch Changes

- f856362: Bump `@pie-lib/math-rendering-module` to `5.0.0` for the PIE-423 math accessibility rendering update.
- c8d46d7: Remove PIE-owned focus-placement APIs and automatic section navigation focus movement.

  This is a breaking cleanup for pre-1.0 hosts: `pie-item-player.focusFirst()`, section-player layout `focusStart()`, `SectionPlayerFocusPolicy.autoFocus`, `DEFAULT_FOCUS_POLICY`, and `resolveAutoFocusStrategy` are no longer exported. The shared `queryFirstFocusableDeep()` and `focusFirstFocusableInElement()` helpers were also removed; `FOCUSABLE_SELECTOR` and `isProgrammaticFocusTarget()` remain for focus-trap internals.

  Hosts should own skip links, landmarks, and page-level focus placement while section player preserves natural tab order into actionable controls.

### Patch Changes

- 26dbea3: PIE-501: harden element loading during section-player section swaps.

  Pre-1.0 lockstep release: every package in the `fixed` block bumps
  together at release time per the project versioning policy. Per pre-1.0
  semver convention every release is a patch bump, even when behavior
  changes are breaking — the breaking changes inventory below is for
  host migration, not for the version bump level. PIE-501
  investigation traced sporadic post-section-swap render failures
  (`Preloaded strategy requires pre-registered elements; missing tags:
…`) to two coupled root causes — a non-truthful element-load promise
  contract, and the section-player rewriting embedded items' loading
  strategy and tracking readiness through cached state. Fixing those
  unblocked a broader architecture-review compat-removal sweep that had
  been gated on the same surfaces.

  This release ships both phases of the PIE-501 plan plus the
  compat-removal work that fell out of the same review. None of the
  removed surfaces are part of the `pie-item` client contract (the only
  allowed compatibility surface per
  `.cursor/rules/legacy-compatibility-boundaries.mdc`).

  ## What's new

  - **Deep `ElementLoader` primitive** (PIE-501 Phase A). A single loader
    primitive whose promise resolves only when every requested custom-
    element tag is actually registered, and rejects with a per-tag
    reason otherwise. Both IIFE and ESM are now adapters over this
    primitive. Replaces the previous parallel `IifeLoader` / `EsmLoader`
    classes in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`. The deep primitive is
    the shipped contract; the strategy name (`iife` / `esm` / `preloaded`)
    selects an adapter rather than a parallel implementation.

  - **Strategy substitution removed** (PIE-501 Phase B). Embedded
    item-players inherit the host's chosen strategy verbatim. The
    section-player still pre-warms the aggregate element set for
    performance but no longer owns correctness through cached state;
    widget readiness is now a function of inputs. The
    `allowPreloadedFallbackLoad` escape hatch is gone.

  - **M5 — strict two-tier mirror rule.** Tier-1 layout-CE props mirror
    to `runtime.*` keys with documented precedence; the resolver enforces
    the mirror per-key.

  - **M6 — canonical stage vocabulary.** `pie-stage-change` (`composed`,
    `engine-ready`, `interactive`, `disposed`) and `pie-loading-complete`
    are the canonical readiness surface, with a toolkit-side stage
    tracker and `onStageChange` / `onLoadingComplete` props on the layout
    CEs.

  - **M7 — `SectionRuntimeEngine`.** A single FSM-driven runtime engine
    consolidates section-controller lifecycle, readiness derivation, and
    stage emissions previously scattered across multiple coordinators.

  - **M8 — tool policy engine.** Allow/block + PNP/profile enforcement become a
    first-class policy surface on `ToolkitCoordinator`
    (`onPolicyChange`, `decideToolPolicy`, `updateToolPlacement`,
    `setPnpEnforcement`, `registerPolicySource`), with narrow profile
    auto-detection mirrored through `runtime.tools.pnpEnforcement`.

  - **`FrameworkErrorBus` contract.** A single canonical
    `framework-error` source, single subscription via
    `onFrameworkError(model: FrameworkErrorModel)`, and the layout-CE
    host emits exactly one `framework-error` per error (the previous
    toolkit-bubble + engine-bridge dual-emit is collapsed — see Removed).

  - **Tabbed section-player layout.** New `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`
    CE alongside the existing splitpane and vertical layouts.

  ## Removed (breaking)

  - **Deprecated `AssessmentToolkitEvents` event-map and member event
    interfaces** (`AssessmentStartedEvent`, `AssessmentCompletedEvent`,
    `AssessmentPausedEvent`, `AssessmentResumedEvent`,
    `CanNavigateChangedEvent`, `InteractionEvent`, `InteractionType`,
    `ItemChangedEvent`, `ItemMetadata`, `LoadCompleteEvent`,
    `LocaleChangedEvent`, `LocaleLoadingCompleteEvent`,
    `LocaleLoadingErrorEvent`, `LocaleLoadingStartEvent`,
    `NavigationRequestEvent`, `PlayerErrorEvent`, `SessionChangedEvent`,
    `StateRestoredEvent`, `StateSavedEvent`, `SyncFailedEvent`,
    `ToolActivatedEvent`, `ToolDeactivatedEvent`,
    `ToolStateChangedEvent`). They were aspirational and never emitted
    from any production path. The canonical replacement surfaces
    (DOM `CustomEvent`s on `<pie-assessment-toolkit>`,
    `ToolkitCoordinator.subscribe*` helpers, and the M3
    framework-error contract) are unchanged.

  - **Deprecated Svelte-store-shaped `toolCoordinatorStore`** and the
    prior `ToolCoordinator` _interface_ (the z-index / visibility shape
    in `packages/assessment-toolkit/src/tools/types.ts`, with
    `registerTool` / `showTool` / `hideTool` / `toggleTool` /
    `bringToFront` / `updateToolElement` / `hideAllTools` /
    `getToolState` / `isToolVisible`). The canonical replacement is the
    class-based `ToolCoordinator` (typed by `ToolCoordinatorApi` in
    `packages/assessment-toolkit/src/services/interfaces.ts`)
    re-exported from `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit` and
    instantiated by `ToolkitCoordinator` as `coordinator.toolCoordinator`.
    All instance methods carry over verbatim, plus a `subscribe()` for
    reactive consumption that replaces the deleted Svelte-store derived
    views. Independently, `ToolkitCoordinator`'s tool-policy surface
    (`onPolicyChange`, `decideToolPolicy`, `updateToolPlacement`,
    `setPnpEnforcement`, `registerPolicySource`) is the canonical entry
    point for the _tool policy_ concern (allow/block + PNP/profile enforcement)
    — that is a different concern than the floating-tool z-index API
    the deleted interface served.

  - **Top-level `createSectionController` prop on every section-player
    layout custom element** (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-vertical>`, `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`,
    `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`, `<pie-section-player-base>`)
    and the corresponding kernel pass-through. The factory is now
    exposed only via `runtime.createSectionController`, the canonical
    M5 entry point.

    Note: `<pie-assessment-toolkit>`'s `createSectionController` prop
    is **unchanged** — the toolkit accepts it directly as part of its
    composition surface.

  - **Top-level `isolation` prop on every section-player layout custom
    element** (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-vertical>`, `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`,
    `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`, `<pie-section-player-base>`)
    and the corresponding kernel pass-through. The isolation strategy
    is now read only from `runtime.isolation`; when omitted, the
    resolver falls back to the package default (`DEFAULT_ISOLATION`).

    Note: the toolkit's `<pie-assessment-toolkit>` keeps `isolation` as a
    JS-only object property (see the toolkit-side carve-out below), but
    the kebab-attribute (`isolation="…"` HTML form) was also removed in
    this sweep. Layout-CE hosts must use `runtime.isolation`; standalone
    toolkit hosts must assign `el.isolation = …` programmatically.

  - **Top-level `item-toolbar-tools` / `passage-toolbar-tools`
    attribute aliases (and their `itemToolbarTools` / `passageToolbarTools`
    prop forms) on every section-player layout custom element**
    (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`, `<pie-section-player-vertical>`,
    `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`, `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`),
    along with the matching one-time deprecation warnings and the
    `parseToolList(itemToolbarTools)` / `parseToolList(passageToolbarTools)`
    absorption inside `resolveToolsConfig`. Per-region tool placement is
    now configured directly on the canonical `tools` object as
    `tools.placement.item` / `tools.placement.passage` (or via
    `runtime.tools.placement.{item,passage}`).

    The kernel re-exposes the canonical placement arrays as
    comma-separated strings via slot props (`itemToolbarTools`,
    `passageToolbarTools`) so internal card / pane custom elements
    (`<pie-section-player-item-card>`, `<pie-section-player-passage-card>`,
    `<pie-section-player-items-pane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-passages-pane>`) keep their existing
    string-attribute contract unchanged.

  - **Deprecated readiness DOM-event aliases on every section-player
    layout custom element** — `readiness-change`, `interaction-ready`,
    and `ready` — along with the engine's `legacy-event-bridge` that
    emitted them, the corresponding `SectionEngineOutput` kinds
    (`readiness-change`, `interaction-ready`, `ready`), the engine
    state fields that gated them (`interactionReadyEmitted`,
    `readyEmitted`, `lastReadinessDetail`), the
    `pie-section-readiness-change` / `pie-section-interaction-ready` /
    `pie-section-ready` instrumentation mappings, and the
    `readinessChange` / `interactionReady` / `ready` entries on
    `SECTION_PLAYER_PUBLIC_EVENTS`. Hosts now consume the canonical
    M6 vocabulary directly:

    - `readiness-change` → `pie-stage-change` (the readiness payload
      is also reachable via the layout CE's `selectReadiness()` /
      `getSnapshot().readiness`).
    - `interaction-ready` → `pie-stage-change` filtered on
      `detail.stage === "interactive"`.
    - `ready` → `pie-loading-complete`.

  - **Deprecated `section-controller-ready` Svelte/DOM event** — the
    kernel-side `dispatch("section-controller-ready", ...)` call,
    the matching `on:section-controller-ready={…}` forwarders on every
    layout CE wrapper (`<pie-section-player-splitpane>`,
    `<pie-section-player-vertical>`, `<pie-section-player-tabbed>`,
    `<pie-section-player-kernel-host>`), the
    `sectionControllerReady` entry on `SECTION_PLAYER_PUBLIC_EVENTS`,
    the `SectionPlayerControllerReadyDetail` type export, and the
    `pie-section-controller-ready` instrumentation mapping in
    `SECTION_INSTRUMENTATION_EVENT_MAP`. The kernel still feeds the
    engine FSM's `section-controller-resolved` input on first
    resolution per cohort (canonical stage progression
    `booting-section → engine-ready`); only the kernel-level Svelte
    event and its DOM-forwarded layout-host emit are gone. The
    toolkit-internal `pie-toolkit-section-controller-ready`
    telemetry name is unchanged. Migration:

    - Pull a controller handle directly:
      `await el.waitForSectionController(timeoutMs)` or
      `el.getSectionController()` on the layout CE.
    - Or filter `pie-stage-change` for
      `detail.stage === "engine-ready"` and then call
      `el.getSectionController()`.

  - **`autoFocusFirstItem` boolean alias on
    `SectionPlayerFocusPolicy`** and the runtime translation logic that
    mapped it onto the canonical `autoFocus` enum (along with its
    one-time deprecation warning). Hosts now set `autoFocus` directly:

    ```ts
    // before
    el.policies = { focus: { autoFocusFirstItem: true } };
    // after
    el.policies = { focus: { autoFocus: "start-of-content" } };
    // (or `"none"` to disable)
    ```

    The two Playwright tests that pinned the deprecated alias contract
    (`section-player-navigation-contract.spec.ts`) are removed.

  - **Orphaned `runtime-event-guards.ts` re-export shim** in
    `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit` (`@deprecated since M7`,
    `createRuntimeId` is the only re-export). Import from
    `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit/runtime/internal` instead.

  - **`one-time warning utility` deprecation-warning utility** and its
    public re-export from `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit`
    (`packages/assessment-toolkit/src/services/deprecation-warnings.ts`,
    along with the test-only `test reset helper` and the
    `one-time warning utility` test block in
    `tests/framework-error-bus.test.ts`). Every internal callsite
    was removed earlier in this sweep; no in-tree code depends on the
    utility. External consumers that imported it from the package
    root should inline a per-callsite `console.warn` (the utility
    was a thin once-per-label, dev-only `console.warn` wrapper).

  - **Toolkit `isolation` kebab-attribute surface on
    `<pie-assessment-toolkit>`.** The `isolation` prop is now a
    JS-only object property (`type: "Object", reflect: false`); the
    previously observed `isolation="…"` HTML attribute is no longer
    parsed. Hosts that set isolation declaratively must move to a
    property assignment (or set it via `runtime.isolation` on the
    enclosing layout CE):

    ```html
    <!-- before -->
    <pie-assessment-toolkit isolation="shadow"></pie-assessment-toolkit>
    ```

    ```ts
    // after
    el.isolation = "shadow";
    ```

  - **Removed `ToolkitCoordinatorHooks` error hooks**
    (`onError`, `onTTSError`, `onProviderError`) and their
    subscription/dispatch logic on `ToolkitCoordinator`, plus the
    internal helpers (`toCauseError`, `contextFromFrameworkErrorModel`,
    `providerIdFromSource`) that synthesized the prior
    `(error, context)` payload from the canonical
    `FrameworkErrorModel`. The single canonical hook is
    `onFrameworkError(model: FrameworkErrorModel)`, which already
    delivers every `framework-error` exactly once per error
    (filterable on `model.kind`). Migration:

    ```ts
    // before
    coordinator.setHooks({
      onError: (error, context) => log({ error, context }),
      onTTSError: (error) => bumpTtsErrorCount(),
      onProviderError: (error, context) => log(context.providerId, error),
    });

    // after
    coordinator.setHooks({
      onFrameworkError: (model) => {
        // model.kind: "tool-config" | "runtime-init" | "runtime-dispose"
        //           | "coordinator-init" | "provider-init" | "provider-register"
        //           | "tts-init" | "tool-state-load" | "tool-state-save"

  - **`framework-error` dual-emit on the layout CE host.** Previously,
    while a `<pie-assessment-toolkit>` was nested inside a layout CE,
    the layout host received **two** `framework-error` DOM events per
    error (one engine-bridge emit on the layout host plus the bubbled
    toolkit emit). The dual-emit is collapsed to a single canonical
    emit: the kernel's `handleFrameworkError` listener at
    `<pie-section-player-base>` now calls `event.stopPropagation()`
    after re-feeding the engine, so the bubbled toolkit emit no
    longer reaches the layout CE host. Outside listeners on the layout
    host now see exactly one `framework-error` per error — the
    engine-bridge emit (target = layout host, non-bubbling,
    non-composed). Direct listeners attached to
    `<pie-assessment-toolkit>` itself are unaffected (the toolkit
    dispatch reaches them before the kernel listener runs). The
    `onFrameworkError` callback prop and the package-internal
    `FrameworkErrorBus` are unchanged — both were already single-fire.
    The single-emit contract is now pinned by
    `packages/section-player/tests/section-player-framework-error-dual-emit.test.ts`
    (the file name is preserved for git blame; the test now asserts
    the single canonical emit).

  - **`allowPreloadedFallbackLoad` escape hatch.** Removed alongside the
    PIE-501 Phase B strategy-substitution work. Hosts that relied on it
    to mask preload-misses should ensure their preload set is correct
    (the `ElementLoader` primitive now rejects deterministically with a
    per-tag reason if a requested tag never registers).

  - **Per-strategy loader classes** (`IifeLoader`, `EsmLoader` and their
    test fixtures) in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`. Replaced by the
    deep `ElementLoader` primitive plus IIFE / ESM adapters. Hosts that
    imported the loader classes directly should switch to
    `ElementLoader`; hosts that only used the public
    `<pie-item-player>` / `<pie-section-player-*>` attribute surface
    need no change.

  ## Migration

  ```ts
  // before
  const el = document.createElement("pie-section-player-splitpane");
  el.createSectionController = () => new SectionController();
  el.isolation = "shadow";
  el.setAttribute("item-toolbar-tools", "calculator,answer-eliminator");
  el.setAttribute("passage-toolbar-tools", "line-reader");

  // after
  el.runtime = {
    createSectionController: () => new SectionController(),
    isolation: "shadow",
    tools: {
      placement: {
        item: ["calculator", "answer-eliminator"],
        passage: ["line-reader"],
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  Section-controller resolution (replaces `section-controller-ready`):

  ```ts
  // before
  el.addEventListener("section-controller-ready", (event) => {
    const { controller } = (event as CustomEvent).detail;
    // …
  });

  // after — pull-style (preferred for one-shot consumers)
  const controller = await(
    el as HTMLElement & {
      waitForSectionController?: (timeoutMs?: number) => Promise<unknown>;
    }
  ).waitForSectionController?.(5000);

  // after — event-driven
  el.addEventListener("pie-stage-change", (event) => {
    const { stage } = (event as CustomEvent).detail;
    if (stage !== "engine-ready") return;
    const controller = (
      el as HTMLElement & { getSectionController?: () => unknown }
    ).getSectionController?.();
    // …
  });
  ```

  `AssessmentToolkitEvents` consumers should subscribe to the canonical
  DOM events / coordinator helpers instead. The Svelte-store coordinator
  had no in-tree consumers; hosts that imported it should switch to the
  class-based `ToolCoordinator` reachable via
  `coordinator.toolCoordinator` on `ToolkitCoordinator` (same method
  shape — `registerTool`, `showTool`, `hideTool`, `toggleTool`,
  `bringToFront`, `updateToolElement`, `hideAllTools`, `getToolState`,
  `isToolVisible` — plus `subscribe(listener)` for reactive consumers
  that previously relied on the Svelte-store derived views).

  ```ts
  // before
  el.addEventListener("readiness-change", (event) => {
    // event.detail: EngineReadinessDetail
  });
  el.addEventListener("interaction-ready", () => {
    // gate "start test" UI
  });
  el.addEventListener("ready", () => {
    // all items loaded
  });

  // after
  import type { StageChangeDetail } from "@pie-players/pie-players-shared/pie";
  import type { EngineReadinessDetail } from "@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit/runtime/internal";

  el.addEventListener("pie-stage-change", (event) => {
    const { stage } = (event as CustomEvent<StageChangeDetail>).detail;
    // stage: "composed" | "engine-ready" | "interactive" | "disposed"
    if (stage === "interactive") {
      // gate "start test" UI
    }
  });
  el.addEventListener("pie-loading-complete", () => {
    // all items loaded (single-shot, cohort-scoped)
  });
  // Readiness payload (formerly the `readiness-change` detail) is also
  // reachable on demand:
  const readiness: EngineReadinessDetail | undefined = el.selectReadiness?.();
  ```

  Hosts that previously de-duplicated `framework-error` listeners on the
  layout CE host (because the same logical error arrived twice — once
  bubbled from the toolkit, once from the engine bridge) can drop that
  de-dup logic: the layout host now fires `framework-error` exactly once
  per error. The canonical `onFrameworkError` callback prop and the
  package-internal `FrameworkErrorBus` were already single-fire and need
  no migration.

- Temporary release changeset: patch all publishable packages to keep lockstep versions.

## 0.3.30

### Patch Changes

- 0981bc3: Bump `@pie-lib/math-rendering-module` from `4.0.7` to `4.1.2` (PIE-147 / PIE-423).

  `math-rendering@4.1.0-next.1` regressed screen-reader support by dropping the
  `mjx-assistive-mml` MathML sibling that MathJax attaches for assistive
  technologies, so screen readers in the item player fell back to reading raw
  glyphs (e.g. "9 1 8") for prompt math. `4.1.2` — via
  [pie-framework/pie-lib#2201](https://github.com/pie-framework/pie-lib/pull/2201) —
  restores the assistive MathML attachment, so VoiceOver / NVDA announce prompt
  and answer-choice math correctly again.

  `players-shared` is the single source of truth for this dependency (enforced by
  `scripts/check-math-rendering-version.mjs`); every consumer — including
  `@pie-players/pie-item-player` — picks this up transitively on their next
  build/publish.

  The existing vite `patch-math-rendering-module-eval` hook in `item-player`
  still neutralizes the `return eval('require')` pattern in the upstream module
  (confirmed present in `4.1.2`), and `assert-no-eval-require-in-output` passes.

- 698aa82: Add `focusFirst()` to `pie-item-player` and nest it after section navigation focuses the current item card.

  - Export `queryFirstFocusableDeep`, `focusFirstFocusableInElement`, `isProgrammaticFocusTarget`, and `FOCUSABLE_SELECTOR` from `@pie-players/pie-players-shared` (deep traversal into **open** shadow roots; same selector basis as the focus trap).
  - `pie-item-player.focusFirst()` moves focus to the first visible interactive control inside the item.
  - Section player scaffold calls `focusFirst()` after programmatic focus lands on an item card (`start-of-content` without passage, and `current-item`).
