## 0.3.65

### Patch Changes

- 411b2cd: **Breaking.** The core no longer synthesizes a default personal-needs profile. A host that supplied none now has none.

  What this does **not** change is which toolbar tools appear. Toolbar candidates come from `tools.placement`, and `PnpPolicySource` only evaluates support ids that appear somewhere in the bound policy inputs — so an empty profile blocks nothing and mandates nothing, and a placement-driven toolbar renders exactly as before. If your tools come from placement, this entry costs you nothing.

  What does change is `ToolkitCoordinator.decideFeaturePolicy(supportId)`. For the 38 ids the derivation used to produce it answered `granted: true` for every host that supplied no profile, and now answers `granted: false` with reason `Feature "…" not configured`. That is the path capabilities without a toolbar placement are gated on — a host surface capability, and any host code asking "is this granted for this learner" outside a toolbar. Supply a profile if you rely on it; the one-line adoption is below.

  `computeDefaultSupports()` derived the fallback profile from every registered tool's `pnpSupportIds`, which reads _registry membership_ as _eligibility tier_. Registration means a capability is policy-addressable; it does not mean "universal, on by default". So an accommodation-tier capability was granted to every student of every host that supplied no profile. The remedy was `ACCOMMODATION_ONLY_SUPPORT_IDS`, a compile-time array naming `signLanguage` — which worked for the one accommodation shipped in this repo and gave a host contributing its own accommodation nothing to add to.

  Which capabilities a deployment grants by default is a property of the program, not of a capability: TTS is a universal feature in one program and a documented accommodation in another. It belongs in policy configuration, alongside the district and test-administration levels that already live there.

  ## What changed

  `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit` drops `computeDefaultSupports()`, `DEFAULT_PERSONAL_NEEDS_PROFILE`, `ACCOMMODATION_ONLY_SUPPORT_IDS` and `createDefaultPersonalNeedsProfile()`. In their place, `createEmptyPersonalNeedsProfile()` returns a profile granting nothing. No alias for the old name: a function called "default" is what invited a populated default in the first place, and the rename is the signal that the return value changed.

  `@pie-players/pie-default-tool-loaders` gains `UNIVERSAL_SUPPORTS_PRESET` and `createUniversalPersonalNeedsProfile()` — the 38 support ids the old derivation produced, frozen as data. Adopt it, extend it, or replace it. It is pinned by a test rather than recomputed, so a diff there is a deliberate program decision instead of a side-effect of registering a tool. It excludes any capability declaring `requiresAuthoredContent`, asserted against `registry.getContentDependentSupportIds()` rather than against a list of ids — which is what lets a host's own accommodation get the same guarantee.

  `section-player` stops injecting a profile into a section that carries none. `pnpEnforcement` auto-detection engages on any non-empty profile, so the injected default silently turned enforcement on for every host — a gate whose profile granted everything, so it could not deny anything. Enforcement now engages only on real host policy material: a profile, a district policy, a test administration block, or item-level tool settings.

  The PNP debugger no longer labels its fallback "toolkit default profile (derived)". Nothing derives one, and that label over an empty `supports` array read as a broken derivation rather than as an unconfigured section.

  ## Migration

  A host that wants the previous grants adds one line at the point it builds a section or assessment:

  ```ts
  import { createUniversalPersonalNeedsProfile } from "@pie-players/pie-default-tool-loaders";

  const section = {
    ...authoredSection,
    personalNeedsProfile: createUniversalPersonalNeedsProfile(),
  };
  ```

  A host already supplying `personalNeedsProfile` is unaffected. The one case that changes a toolbar: a host that relied on the implicit default _and_ supplies `settings.districtPolicy` or `settings.testAdministration`. Enforcement stays on from that material, and there are now no supports to satisfy a `requiredTools` entry or to survive a `blockedTools` one.

  `@pie-players/pie-item-player` consumers are unaffected — it does not depend on the toolkit.

  This supersedes the statement in the sign-language catalog media region entry, which described `signLanguage` being filtered out of the computed default by id. Both the computation and the filter are gone; signing stays out of a wholesale grant because it declares a content dependency, not because it is named.

- 3972f16: **Breaking for capability packages.** `ToolSurfaceRenderResult.sync` takes the current render context: `sync?: (context: ToolSurfaceRenderContext) => void`.

  It took no argument, so a registration had nothing to read but the context captured when it rendered. A host reconciles surface capabilities by `toolId` and calls `sync` rather than remounting — a `<video>` recreated mid-playback restarts the recording — so `sync` is the _only_ path a re-resolve has to an element already on screen, and with a captured context it re-applied the values the host already had. Two live consequences: a signed alternate re-resolved to a different recording (a `signLang` parameter change, or a catalog registering after first paint) left the learner watching the previous one, and a host calling `updateAssessment(...)` mid-session left the annotation gateway wired to the previous coordinator. Both were silent.

  Update a registration by reading the parameter instead of the closure:

  ```diff
  -const applyProps = () => {
  -  element.media = context.content;
  +const applyProps = (current: ToolSurfaceRenderContext) => {
  +  element.media = current.content;
   };
  -applyProps();
  +applyProps(context);
   return { element, sync: applyProps };
  ```

  ## Host surfaces a region capability can actually reach

  `section-overlay` gated every capability on `decideToolPolicy`, whose candidates are seeded only from `tools.placement` — and placing an `activation: "region"` capability is a `tools.unplaceableActivation` error at `error` severity. A capability that is only ever a region was therefore unreachable on that surface in both directions, and the mechanism worked for exactly the one capability that motivated it, which also has a toolbar activation. Region capabilities are now gated on `decideFeaturePolicy`, matching the item-media surface; placement-driven ones keep the placement question, which is where their candidacy comes from.

  `item-media` now awaits `ensureToolModuleLoaded` before mounting, so a capability registered through the documented lazy module-loader path renders instead of silently missing its element. This costs a capability that registers its element eagerly one microtask.

  `requiresAuthoredContent` is resolvable only on a surface the host renders per item or per passage. `CatalogOwnerContext` names an item model or a passage and never a section, because a DRD resource pairs with content rather than with a container — so `section-overlay` now declines a capability declaring one, with a console warning, instead of mounting it with `content: undefined`. That is documented on the contract; `resolve` must also be synchronous and return JSON-serializable content, both of which hosts already relied on and neither of which was stated.

  ## Item media region lifecycle

  Three fixes in `SectionItemCard`, all reachable by toggling an accommodation at runtime:

  - **Losing the last grant destroys the region, and the mount effect treated a missing anchor as "nothing to do."** The capability's `destroy()` never ran, so a detached `<video>` kept playing audio, and its entry stayed in the mounted map — so the next grant found an "existing" mount that was no longer in the document and the region stayed blank for the rest of the session. It now tears down, matching what the section-overlay surface already did.
  - **The region and its keyboard-focusable resize divider followed the grant count, not what mounted.** `renderSurface` returning `null` is a legitimate answer — a host that remapped the element tag through `toolTagMap` to one it never defined takes that path — which produced an empty 34% column with a handle dividing nothing. Both now follow the mounted count.
  - **Both surface anchors are `display: contents`.** They were always-present elements generating their own box: the overlay anchor as a permanent flex item shifting `gap` and child-index selectors, the media anchor breaking any `height: 100%` chain between the region and the capability's element.

  ## Guarantee that was asserted but not enforced

  `UNIVERSAL_SUPPORTS_PRESET`'s exclusion of content-dependent accommodations was a hardcoded `not.toContain("signLanguage")`, with a comment deferring the declaration-driven form to the step that has now landed. It reads `registry.getContentDependentSupportIds()`, which had no caller outside its own unit test, and a second assertion covers the other half: no packaged registration declares a content dependency, so a twelfth one could not pass by being invisible to the first check.

  ## PNP debugger

  Region capabilities no longer get per-level placement toggles or an "all available tools" entry. Clicking one wrote config that fails `tools.unplaceableActivation` at `error` severity, and the "visible" marker beside it read a placement-scoped decision a region capability is never in — so it reported "not visible" while the capability was correctly rendering. Rows show `host surface (not placed)` and, for a content-dependent capability, what has to be authored, which is what `contentDependencyDescription` was added for.

### Patch Changes

- 99929d8: Move debugger panel styling out of the shared content stylesheet and into the panels that own it.

  `components.css` carried a `SECTION PLAYER DEBUGGER OVERLAYS` block styling the PNP
  and session debugger panels. That file is for authored-content classes no component
  owns, so panel-private rules did not belong in it, and the split was already
  inconsistent: each panel defined most of its own classes locally and left a handful
  behind.

  Those rules now live in each panel's own `<style>` block. The two classes applied by
  `SharedFloatingPanel` rather than by the panel template — the panel root and
  `__content-shell` — are wrapped in `:global()`, since Svelte would otherwise scope
  them to the panel component and they would match nothing.

  Of the 37 classes in the removed block, 14 were referenced nowhere at all
  (`__header*`, `__title`, `__icon-button`, `__icon-xs`, `__resize-*`) — leftovers from
  before `SharedFloatingPanel` renamed those parts to `pie-shared-floating-panel__*`.
  They were deleted rather than relocated.

  Five panels also dropped a `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` import that never
  did anything: these packages build with Vite in library mode, so the import was
  extracted to a `dist` CSS file that the built JS never referenced and that no
  `exports` entry exposed — the same defect fixed for `PieItemPlayer.svelte`. Each
  package now ships one fewer dead file.

  If you import `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` directly and relied on the
  `pie-section-player-tools-{pnp,session}-debugger*` classes it used to define, they are
  no longer there; they ship with their panel packages instead.
