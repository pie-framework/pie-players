### Patch Changes

- c16c77c: Mark eliminated answer choices that are not made of text: an X over images, and a
  line-through over rendered math, both in the same strike colour as the text.

  The strikethrough strategy paints with the CSS Custom Highlight API, which — like
  `text-decoration` — only draws on text. An answer choice whose content is a
  picture therefore looked completely untouched after being eliminated: the student
  got a pressed toggle button and nothing else.

  Images are replaced elements, so they cannot carry a pseudo-element either. Each
  `img` in an eliminated choice is now wrapped in a positioned
  `span.pie-answer-eliminator-image-strike` that hosts an absolutely-positioned SVG
  overlay drawing two diagonals corner to corner — upper-left to lower-right and
  lower-left to upper-right — for a big X over the whole image. Wrapping (rather
  than measuring and re-positioning an overlay) keeps the X glued to the image
  through later reflow: responsive resizing, a late image `load`, zoom.

  The wrapper preserves the image's own box: a fluid image that already spans its
  parent gets a block wrapper, a block-level image gets a `fit-content` block
  wrapper so it stays on its own line at its own width, and the wrapper's line box
  is collapsed so no descender gap lets the X overhang the artwork. Restoring the
  choice unwraps the image and returns the DOM to its original shape.

  The overlay is `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events: none` — the eliminated state is
  already announced on the label — and each diagonal is painted over a wider light
  casing line (`--pie-answer-eliminator-image-strike-casing-color`) so the X clears
  3:1 (SC 1.4.11) over dark artwork.

  ## Rendered math

  Math had the same problem for a different reason. MathJax's CHTML output draws
  every visible glyph as an `mjx-c` element with empty `textContent` — the character
  comes from `::before` generated content, which belongs to no Range — and its SVG
  output has no text at all. The highlight was painting only MathJax's
  `mjx-assistive-mml` copy of the source MathML, which is clipped to 1px, so a
  math-only choice looked identical to an un-eliminated one.

  For each `mjx-container` in an eliminated choice, the inner `mjx-math` box is now
  marked with `pie-answer-eliminator-math-strike` and painted by the theme. The
  rendered math box is an ordinary element, so this needs only a class and a
  pseudo-element — no wrapper, and MathJax's own layout is untouched.

  Which mark depends on the shape of the expression. A single row of symbols takes
  the centred line-through the prose takes. An expression that draws horizontal
  rules of its own — a fraction bar, a table rule — takes the diagonals an
  eliminated image takes, because a centred line lands on the math axis, exactly
  where the fraction bar already sits, and reads as a recoloured bar rather than an
  elimination. The split is structural (`mjx-mfrac`, `mjx-mtable`) rather than
  height-based: an inline `a/b` is only 1.16x its font size, indistinguishable in
  height from a radical (1.17x) or a parenthesised row (1.10x), yet it is precisely
  the colliding case. Radicals and stacked limits keep the line — their bars sit at
  the top, or the strike simply crosses the base.

  The paint target is the inner `mjx-math`, not the container: for inline math
  `mjx-container` is `display: inline`, so its rect is the surrounding line box — a
  constant ~1.16x font size whatever it holds — while the expression overflows it,
  a fraction by 3px above and 8px below. Painting the container both mismeasured
  the expression and drew the line in the wrong place.

  Only MathJax containers are marked. Natively rendered MathML keeps real text in
  `mi`/`mn`/`mo`, so the highlight already strikes every token there, and marking it
  too would double the line over one expression.

  ## One strike colour

  Text, images, and math all read `--pie-answer-eliminator-strike-color` (defaulting
  to `--pie-incorrect`), so a choice mixing prose, pictures, and math reads as a
  single treatment rather than three, and a host can restyle every part of an
  elimination from one property.

- 3f6e33a: Signing becomes a capability package. New `@pie-players/pie-tool-sign-language`, and no package in the player names signing any more.

  The last capability-specific code in the generic core was signing's: the toolkit validated `sign-language` catalog cards, and section-player's item card knew the `signLanguage` support id, the catalog type, the language-matching rule and the region element by name. So the one accommodation PIE most needs hosts to be able to add was the one thing only we could add.

  ## The new package

  `@pie-players/pie-tool-sign-language` owns `signLanguageRegistration` (`activation: "region"`, `surfaces: ["item-media"]`, `supportedLevels: ["item"]`, `requiresAuthoredContent`), the card validators and language matching that were `services/sign-language-cards.ts` in the toolkit, the content resolver that was the signing half of section-player's `section-item-media.ts`, and `<pie-tool-sign-language>`, which was `SectionItemMediaRegion.svelte`.

  It is authored against `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit/tools/internal` — the same entry point our packaged registrations use — and it is the worked example of a capability contributed from outside the player. A host opts in with two lines:

  ```ts
  import { signLanguageRegistration } from "@pie-players/pie-tool-sign-language";
  registry.register(signLanguageRegistration);
  ```

  Importing the package registers the element, so there is no module-loader entry to add.

  **Deliberately not in `createPackagedToolRegistry` or `DEFAULT_TOOL_MODULE_LOADERS.`** An accommodation with an authored-content dependency is a deployment's decision: a default that granted it would hand signing to every learner whose item happened to carry a card. The `apps/section-demos` `sign-language` route now registers it itself, which is the demonstration that a host can contribute a capability with no id of ours involved.

  ## What section-player kept and what it lost

  `SectionItemCard.svelte` iterates `getToolsBySurface("item-media")`, decides each capability against **its own** `pnpSupportIds`, calls its `requiresAuthoredContent.resolve`, and mounts through `ToolRegistry.renderForSurface`. It names no capability, no support id, no catalog type and no element tag, and it does not depend on the signing package — `check:player-tool-boundaries` forbids even the string.

  The region's own layout stays here, because it is the card's geometry rather than the capability's: `MEDIA_REGION_*`, `clampMediaRegionPercent`, `mediaRegionPercentFromDrag` and `SectionCardSplitDivider`. The three `--pie-section-player-item-media-*` tokens keep their names — hosts set them and PIE-880 is in testing against them — but the registry now records the signing package as their owner.

  Two behaviours the old file documented are preserved and re-keyed generically, because both were load-bearing: the `onCatalogsChange` re-resolve with a resolve-once-on-subscribe, and the write-only-when-the-signature-changed guard. That guard is not an optimisation. Re-rendering the card re-applies `item` on `<pie-item-shell>`, which re-registers the item's catalogs, which makes the resolver emit again; one unconditional write per emission makes the cycle self-sustaining and Svelte aborts at its depth limit with the DOM half-applied.

  ## Contract changes

  `isVisibleInContext` is now optional on `ToolRegistration`, required for the two toolbar activations and rejected only when present and not a function. A region capability has no toolbar presence to be relevant to, and the question it would answer — is there anything to show here — is `requiresAuthoredContent`. A registration that omits it is never returned by `getVisibleTools`. Callers that invoke it on a registration they wrap need `?.` — the one in-repo case was a demo decorator.

  `applyMediaFragment` reached the public surface through `sign-language-cards.js`; it is now exported from `services/catalog-media.js` directly, along with `isSafeMediaSrc`, `normalizeMediaSources`, `normalizeMediaFragment` and `trimmedOrUndefined` — the validators any capability package needs to read a media payload. The signing-specific exports (`SIGN_LANGUAGE_CATALOG_TYPE`, `AMERICAN_SIGN_LANGUAGE`, `describeSignLanguage`, `isSignLanguageCard`, `matchesRequestedSignLanguage`, `resolveSignLanguageMedia`, `SignLanguageMedia`) move to the new package.

  `packages/players-shared`'s `SignLanguageCardPayload` stays. It is authored wire data alongside `CatalogCard`, and a published shape for a standard support id is not a core dependency on a capability — the same argument that exempts `pnp-standard-features.ts`.

  ## Behaviour

  Unchanged, and that is the whole point. PIE-880 is in testing, so the guard is that its specs pass with import-path edits and **no assertion changes**: `section-player-sign-language-region.spec.ts` and `pie881-imported-asl-integration.spec.ts` (14 specs, including the re-registration-loop and keyboard-divider cases), plus the unit tests, now split between `sign-language-content.test.ts` in the new package and the sizing half left behind.

  `check:fixed-versioning` treated a 404 from npm as a failure, so adding any publishable package broke it. A never-published package is now reported and excluded from the version-sequence comparison; a network or auth failure still stops the gate, because "cannot tell" must not read as "fine".

## 0.3.64

### Patch Changes

- dc44392: Make the frame's masking a host setting rather than a student one. How much surrounding context a test taker can still see trades against reading focus, which is a decision a programme makes for its whole population, so `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-opacity` is now the only way to change it: the keyboard-only `[`/`]` adjustment — undiscoverable to anyone not reading the tool's aria-label, and with no pointer equivalent — is gone, and the component no longer writes the opacity inline, so a host declaration wins without `!important`.

  Promote the frame's masking properties to registered host contract. `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-opacity`, `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-color`, and `--pie-tool-line-reader-control-color` are now `component-public` entries in `packages/theme/src/token-registry.json` instead of package-private internals, since a deployment is expected to configure them and needs the compatibility guarantee that carries. The control colour is registered as the fill's companion: the glyphs sit on the frame and default to white for a dark scrim, so a light fill has to set it too and keep 3:1 against the fill. `--pie-tool-line-reader-outline-color` stays package-private.

- a5241b9: Render `sign-language` accessibility catalog cards. `sign-language` has been a declared `CatalogType` with no consumer since catalogs landed — only `spoken` was wired, through `TTSService` — so an item carrying an ASL video showed the question and no video. This adds the four pieces that make signed alternates appear, deliberately shaped as a second instance of the spoken/TTS path rather than as new machinery.

  ## Card payload

  `CatalogCard.content` is a flat string, so a signing card could only hold a bare URL — no second source, no MIME type, no poster, no time range, all of which QTI 3 expresses inside `qti-card-entry`. `CatalogCard` gains an optional structured `payload`, and `players-shared` gains the media vocabulary it uses (`MediaAssetRef`, `MediaSource`, `TextTrackRef`, `TranscriptRef`, `MediaFragmentRange`, `SignLanguageCardPayload`).

  A card carries **either** `content` **or** `payload`, never both. QTI gives `qti-card` one content slot and names the type in `@support`, which PIE already models as `CatalogCard.catalog`; so `content` is the string form for types a string can express (SSML for `spoken`), `payload` is the structured form for types it cannot, and `catalog` is the only discriminator. Two consequences, both deliberate:

  - **`content` becomes optional.** A signing card has no string form at all. Nothing is projected or mirrored into `content`, so there is never a second copy of the payload's primary URL to fall out of sync with it — and no precedence rule silently deciding which copy wins. `ResolvedCatalog.content` is optional for the same reason; `TTSService` treats a card with no string form as "no catalog", falling through to generated speech.
  - **The payload carries no `kind` tag.** Restating `catalog` inside the payload would be a second source of truth for the type that can disagree with the first. Consumers select a card by catalog type and then validate the payload structurally, which they must do anyway for authored wire data.

  One media vocabulary rather than two: `MediaAssetRef` is defined against both this consumer and prospective stimulus media, with the required subset resolved per consumer instead of by making every field optional at the type level — a type where nothing is required stops catching anything. For signing, sources and language are required, poster and duration do not apply, and `tracks`/`transcript` are actively meaningless, since captions on a signing video would be the English text already on screen. Stated explicitly so no future policy adds a caption requirement to signed content.

  Validation is "treat as absent, never as text": a payload with no usable source resolves to `null` instead of rendering an empty player or a URL as visible content, and a `sign-language` card carrying a bare URL in `content` is reported and ignored rather than half-rendered. Source URLs are restricted to schemes a media element can actually fetch, so an authored `javascript:` or `file:` URL cannot ride into the DOM.

  ## Extraction

  `SignLanguageExtractor` is the signing counterpart of `SSMLExtractor` and exists for the same reason: authors carry the accessibility material inline, and the runtime needs catalog cards. It probes content for `data-sign-language` regions, lifts the video into a card with sources, poster and an optional `data-sign-language-start` / `-end` range, removes it from the visible markup, and docks the catalog on the content it translates via `data-catalog-idref`.

  Removing the video from visible content is the substantive divergence from Learnosity, where a signing video is ordinary item content that renders unconditionally with nothing to gate. In PIE it becomes catalog data that policy decides on.

  An existing `data-catalog-idref` is never overwritten. The attribute is one canonical name with two readers, and clobbering it would break TTS resolution for that node; the synthesized catalog is still emitted and still resolves, because the region finds cards through the item's catalog set rather than by walking the DOM.

  ## Resolution

  Lookup goes through `AccessibilityCatalogResolver.getAlternative(catalogId, { type: "sign-language", language })`, so assessment/item/scoped priority and owner scoping are not re-implemented. `ResolvedCatalog` now carries the card's `payload`.

  Owner scoping needed one consolidation to make that true. Catalogs are placed dynamically — a shell registers what its entity carries on mount, and readers resolve by identifier within an owner scope — so registration and lookup have to agree on where a catalog is filed, and the resolver matches contexts field by field, meaning a disagreement resolves nothing rather than failing loudly. The walk over the three places catalogs hang off an entity, and the construction of the context each is filed under, now live in one place: `collectEntityCatalogRegistrations` and `catalogOwnerContextFor`, both exported from `pie-assessment-toolkit`, with the runtime registration event handler reduced to an adapter over the first. The media region borrows the walk rather than repeating it, so a lookup cannot name a scope registration never wrote.

  One behaviour is deliberately stricter than the resolver's default. Its last fallback rung matches any card of the requested type regardless of language, which is helpful for spoken content and wrong for signing: ASL, BSL and LSF are not interchangeable, so handing an ASL learner a BSL recording is worse than handing them nothing. A card reached by that rung is accepted only if its language matches, or if it asserts no language at all — a card that names no language cannot be shown to be a mismatch, while one that positively claims another language can.

  ## Policy

  Signing is gated on the `signLanguage` PNP support id through the existing six-level `PnpPolicySource` precedence. Because the region is not a toolbar surface, a placement-scoped `decide(...)` would answer the wrong question — absent because it was never placed, not because policy said no — so `ToolPolicyEngine.decideFeature(featureId)` and `ToolkitCoordinator.decideFeaturePolicy(featureId)` resolve one feature id independent of placement. `PnpPolicySource.resolveFeature(...)` reuses the existing rule evaluation rather than copying the six levels, so the two cannot drift.

  `pnpEnforcement` is not consulted for a feature decision: that flag governs whether profile policy _refines_ an otherwise-visible tool set, and a feature with no placement has no unrefined baseline to fall back to, so skipping the profile read would make the accommodation permanently unavailable rather than merely unrefined.

  `computeDefaultSupports()` now excludes `ACCOMMODATION_ONLY_SUPPORT_IDS`, which lists `signLanguage`. That function derives the fallback profile from every registered tool's `pnpSupportIds`, which is right for universal features and wrong for an accommodation: signing requires a documented need, so inheriting it by default would invert the eligibility tier. Excluded by id rather than by declining to register, so the guarantee holds however a signing tool later reaches the registry. Hosts that supply their own profile are unaffected.

  ## Region

  `SectionItemCard.svelte` gains a `data-region="media"` region beside its existing `header` and `content` regions, holding a resolved catalog card. Named for the slot rather than its first tenant — audio description is the same "docked alternate media, gated by PNP" shape.

  `item-player` needs no changes and learns nothing about signing.

  - **Fixed to the right of the content.** Not below: signing is re-checked _while_ an answer is being formed, so a bottom placement means scrolling between video and choices repeatedly. Side by side keeps both visible however long the item is, and the region is sticky within the card so it follows a long question down. Being parallel rather than sequential also sidesteps a problem an above/below split cannot solve, since `item-player` renders prompt and choices as one opaque block.
  - **Resizable** via a keyboard-accessible `role="separator"` divider following `SectionSplitDivider.svelte`'s shape rather than reusing it — that component is wired to the passage/items grid and converts a drag with a fixed 0.1%-per-pixel factor. Inside a card the same drag has to mean the same thing whether the card is wide or narrow, so the math here is container-relative.
  - **Sized for legibility** by an aspect-ratio target with a height floor, not a flat width percentage, which either wastes space on a short clip or crushes signing on a narrow device. Retunable via `--pie-section-player-item-media-aspect-ratio`, `--pie-section-player-item-media-min-height` and `--pie-section-player-item-media-max-height`. Below a 560px card width the region stacks and the divider withdraws.
  - No orientation toggle and no free repositioning. Free 2D positioning is the floating-tool pattern, built for movable utility windows; the `toolParameters` seam is the right place for a policy-driven generalization, and nothing hangs there yet.

  The split wrapper is always present and the content region always occupies the same slot within it, so a card resolving after mount adds siblings rather than re-creating the item player. An item with no signing markup comes back from extraction by reference, so nothing downstream sees config churn.

  Playback is a minimal `<video>` wrapper: the clips are seconds long, so sharing a player with a section-scale stimulus element buys nothing. Its own audio is muted by default, its accessible name states the language ("American Sign Language") rather than saying "video", and starting it pauses TTS — the action the learner just took wins.

  ## Availability

  Signing appears when **both** conditions hold: the item carries a matching card, and policy grants eligibility. Both are checked independently and neither is a default. The content half is AfA's resource-side declaration (QTI approximates DRD in-band — the presence of a card _is_ the declaration) and is what keeps the region off the overwhelming majority of items, so a learner with the accommodation still sees no dead affordance where no signing was authored.

  ## Also

  `AssessmentSection` gains an optional `personalNeedsProfile`. Section players already read it (falling back to `settings.personalNeedsProfile`, then to the computed default) through an `any` cast; this types an existing runtime contract.

## 0.3.63

## 0.3.62

### Patch Changes

- c73c995: Give the annotation toolbar outline and the annotation underline their own contrast-checked tokens, so neither depends on a token that cannot satisfy WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11.

  ## Toolbar outline

  The floating toolbar's stroke is the only boundary between it and the content
  behind it, so it has to clear 3:1 against both. It was derived from
  `--pie-border`, which cannot carry that: the DaisyUI bridge maps that token to
  `--color-base-300`, a surface tint rather than a boundary colour — `#eeeeee` at
  1.16:1 on the light base, `#15191e` at 1.12:1 on the dark one.

  The outline now reads a new `--pie-tool-annotation-toolbar-border`, defaulting to
  a measured `light-dark(#5c5c5c, #949494)` pair — dark grey on light surfaces,
  light grey on dark ones.

  Both arms are measured against the surfaces the toolbar is actually drawn on
  rather than against pure white and pure black. Real theme bases are off-white and
  off-black, and a grey chosen at the edge of passing against an extreme drops under
  threshold on everything else: across DaisyUI's 21 light and 14 dark themes, every
  light surface needs a grey no lighter than `#828282` and every dark surface one no
  darker than `#878787`. Those ranges are disjoint, so one value cannot serve both
  and `light-dark()` is the mechanism. `#5c5c5c` holds 5.22:1 as its worst case on
  the light surfaces and `#949494` holds 3.56:1 on the dark ones.

  `@pie-players/pie-theme` then hands the last word back to palettes that do choose
  a boundary colour deliberately:

  - `[data-theme="dark"]` and `pie-theme[theme="dark"]` pin the dark arm,
    `#949494`. `light-dark()` keys off the declared `color-scheme`, which pie-theme
    does not set, so without this a pie-theme dark page would take the light arm.
  - All ten `data-color-scheme` accessibility palettes map the outline to their own
    `--pie-border`, which each picks for maximum contrast against its own
    background. This rule sits after the dark rule deliberately — the two have
    equal specificity and a scheme can be active on a dark page. The schemes are
    named rather than matched with a bare `[data-color-scheme]`, so an unknown id
    cannot pull in the `:root` values (`--pie-border` is `#9a9a9a`, which misses 3:1
    on white).

  - Each palette also fixes which underline value applies. The underline default is
    selected by `[data-theme]`, which reports what the _page_ declares rather than
    which scheme is active — so a host declaring itself light while running a dark
    scheme pinned the light value over a dark background.

    The colours themselves were never the problem, so they are unchanged: `#4221d5`
    and `#9c89ec` clear 3:1 between them on nine of the ten backgrounds, and each
    scheme is simply given the arm that suits its own. Both states get that one
    value, because within a scheme the background is fixed regardless of what
    `data-theme` reports. Worst case is 4.33:1 (`light-gray-on-dark-gray`).

    `yellow-on-navy` is the sole exception: its `#33508a` background is mid-tone and
    neither arm reaches 3:1 (1.10 light, 2.71 dark), so there alone the underline
    defers to the palette's own `--pie-primary` (`#ffff99`, 7.54:1) — the same
    deference the outline makes to `--pie-border`.

    All three tokens are declared in both delivery routes: per scheme in
    `color-schemes.ts`, so `<pie-theme scheme="…">` applies them as inline styles
    with no CSS import, and in `color-schemes.css` for hosts that set
    `data-color-scheme` themselves.

  `--pie-tool-annotation-toolbar-border` is registered as a `component-public`
  token. Hosts overriding it must keep 3:1 against both the toolbar surface and the
  content behind it.

  ## Annotation underline

  `::highlight(annotation-underline)` took its colour from `--pie-primary`, a theme
  accent chosen against one background and therefore illegible on the other. It now
  reads `--pie-annotation-underline` (default `#4221d5`) and
  `--pie-annotation-underline-dark` (default `#9c89ec`). One value cannot serve
  both: `#4221d5` is 2.41:1 on black and `#9c89ec` is 2.85:1 on white. Each state
  gets its own token so overriding one never silently moves the other, and so
  either can beat a host-set `--pie-primary` — a `var()` fallback can never
  override a value the host actually set.

  The `prefers-color-scheme` media query only reports the OS preference, which is a
  guess at what the page is showing. Three mutually exclusive `[data-theme]` rules
  now override it: explicit `light` and `dark` take the matching default, and any
  other value — including DaisyUI theme ids — follows that theme's accent, falling
  back to the light default. All three carry attribute selectors, so they outrank
  the bare rules including the one inside the media query, whatever the source
  order.

  ## Upgrade note

  Two host overrides stop having their old effect, which is the point of the change
  rather than a side effect of it:

  - Setting `--pie-border` no longer recolours the annotation toolbar outline; set
    `--pie-tool-annotation-toolbar-border`.
  - Setting `--pie-primary` no longer recolours the annotation underline; set
    `--pie-annotation-underline` and `--pie-annotation-underline-dark`. A host that
    declares `data-theme` with neither token set still follows its accent.

- c73c995: Add four built-in accessibility color schemes: Grey on Light Grey, Purple on Light Green, Black on Violet, and Yellow on Navy.

  Each scheme ships in both places a scheme has to exist to be usable:

  - a `[data-color-scheme="<id>"]` block in `color-schemes.css`, setting the full
    token set (text, primary/secondary/tertiary, backgrounds, borders, focus, and
    correct/incorrect/missing states) so a host can activate it with the attribute
    alone.
  - a `BUILTIN_PIE_COLOR_SCHEMES` entry in `color-schemes.ts`, carrying the
    variables a scheme applies programmatically plus the `preview` swatch trio
    (`bg`, `text`, `primary`) that scheme pickers render.

  Purely additive: the six pre-existing schemes are untouched, and a host that
  sets no `data-color-scheme` is unaffected.

- 14666b3: Install the shared PIE content stylesheet from the player instead of requiring hosts to import it.

  `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` holds classes that authored content depends on but no component owns: passage markup (`.numbered-paragraph`, `.p-number`, `div.passage-title`), the legacy `kds-*` families, and the `pie-answer-eliminator-*` styles. `PieItemPlayer.svelte` already imported that stylesheet, but in this package's Vite library build a plain CSS import is extracted to `dist/assets/pie-item-player.css` — a file nothing loads at runtime and no `exports` entry exposes. The import was a silent no-op, so hosts rendered authored passages unstyled unless they happened to import the stylesheet themselves, which was documented nowhere.

  `@pie-players/pie-item-player` now inlines the stylesheet as text (`?raw`) and installs it once per document at import time, alongside custom-element registration, so it is in place before any instance renders. The separately importable session-debugger entry installs it too. The orphaned `dist/assets/pie-item-player.css` is no longer emitted. `@pie-players/pie-section-player` and `@pie-players/pie-assessment-player` are covered transitively, since they render items through the item player.

  The stylesheet is prepended to `<head>` and deliberately left unlayered, so host CSS that loads later still wins at equal specificity — the placement hosts were previously told to arrange by hand. A cascade layer would have been wrong here: unlayered author declarations beat all layered ones regardless of specificity, so a host reset as broad as `p { margin: 0 }` would have silently outranked `.numbered-paragraph { margin-left: 36px }`.

  Hosts that want to own the stylesheet can set `<html data-pie-content-styles="host">` before the player script runs; the player then installs nothing and warns once if no content stylesheet turns out to be present. `components.css` declares `--pie-content-styles` on `:root` as the presence sentinel behind that check.

  Upgrading hosts do not have to remove an existing `import "@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css"` for this release to be correct: installation is idempotent, and two matching copies render identically. But a host copy loads later than the installed one and therefore wins ties at equal specificity, so a host copy pinned to an older `@pie-players/pie-theme` would silently override newer player rules. Rather than leave that to be discovered, the players now log a one-time warning naming the redundant import when they detect a second copy in the document.

  `@pie-players/pie-print-player` installs it the same way, from its `src/index.ts` entry. This player never told hosts to import the stylesheet at all, so it had no working route to these styles. The gap is worse than a cosmetic one here: `components.css` owns `@media print { .noprint, .kds-noprint { display: none } }`, so a missing copy did not just render authored passage markup unstyled — it printed content the author had marked as non-printing. Nothing in the package strips authored classes on the way through; `processMarkup` swaps only the interactive element tags and returns the surrounding markup verbatim, and `pie-print` renders into light DOM (`createRenderRoot()` returns `this`), so a document-level stylesheet is the only thing that can reach that content.

  New in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared`: `installContentStyles`, `contentStylesPresent`, `contentStylesOptedOut`, `auditContentStyles`, plus a narrow `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/ui/content-styles` export. Print player imports through that subpath rather than the package root, because players-shared declares `sideEffects: true` and print player externalizes nothing — the root barrel would have bundled all of players-shared into `print-player.js`.

  Hosts that already import `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` need no change — installation is idempotent and a duplicate host copy simply wins on document order.

- 99929d8: Move debugger panel styling out of the shared content stylesheet and into the panels that own it.

  `components.css` carried a `SECTION PLAYER DEBUGGER OVERLAYS` block styling the PNP
  and session debugger panels. That file is for authored-content classes no component
  owns, so panel-private rules did not belong in it, and the split was already
  inconsistent: each panel defined most of its own classes locally and left a handful
  behind.

  Those rules now live in each panel's own `<style>` block. The two classes applied by
  `SharedFloatingPanel` rather than by the panel template — the panel root and
  `__content-shell` — are wrapped in `:global()`, since Svelte would otherwise scope
  them to the panel component and they would match nothing.

  Of the 37 classes in the removed block, 14 were referenced nowhere at all
  (`__header*`, `__title`, `__icon-button`, `__icon-xs`, `__resize-*`) — leftovers from
  before `SharedFloatingPanel` renamed those parts to `pie-shared-floating-panel__*`.
  They were deleted rather than relocated.

  Five panels also dropped a `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` import that never
  did anything: these packages build with Vite in library mode, so the import was
  extracted to a `dist` CSS file that the built JS never referenced and that no
  `exports` entry exposed — the same defect fixed for `PieItemPlayer.svelte`. Each
  package now ships one fewer dead file.

  If you import `@pie-players/pie-theme/components.css` directly and relied on the
  `pie-section-player-tools-{pnp,session}-debugger*` classes it used to define, they are
  no longer there; they ship with their panel packages instead.

- c810459: Make the documented active/open trigger hooks work again in the inline TTS tool.

  `README.md` documents `--pie-tool-trigger-active-background`, `-color` and
  `-border-color` as the supported way to style the trigger while its panel is
  open, instead of overriding broad tokens such as `--pie-primary`. The component
  referenced none of them, so a host following the documentation got no effect.
  PIE-727 added these hooks for exactly this control; they were lost in a later
  refactor, and the stale registry metadata pointing at this package is what
  surfaced it.

  All three now apply while `aria-expanded="true"`, which the markup already
  maintains.

  Each hook falls back to the value the control already resolves to, so setting
  none of them leaves the trigger looking identical open and closed. That is
  deliberate: unlike the calculator's equivalent hooks, this trigger has never had
  a filled active look — the panel opening is itself the state indication — and
  introducing one would restyle a shipped control for every host. The README
  previously claimed the unset default derived from `--pie-primary`, which had
  never shipped here; it now describes the actual fallbacks.

  Verified in Chromium by comparing the three properties as sRGB bytes rather than
  as computed-style strings, since routing an identical value through one more
  `var()` layer changes the colour space Chromium serialises to. With the hooks
  unset, open matches closed exactly. With them set, all three take effect, and
  they stop applying once `aria-expanded` goes false.

  The token registry regains this package in `definedIn` for the three hooks.
