### Patch Changes

- 27284f8: Re-register a tool with the coordinator when the coordinator instance changes,
  so stacking and visibility keep working after a runtime-context republish.
  
  Six tools registered once and never again. The guard was a `$state` boolean
  flipped inside a tracked `$effect` — `if (coordinator && toolId && !registered)`
  — so the first coordinator to arrive won permanently. The coordinator does not
  arrive once: it is read from the runtime context (a prop, for text-to-speech),
  and a republish hands over a new instance. After one, the tool's z-index layer,
  `bringToFront` and visibility-restore were all still pointing at a coordinator
  nobody consults, and the new one had never heard of the tool — so a ruler would
  not raise above a protractor, and a tool hidden and reshown lost its position.
  Teardown had the mirror fault: it unregistered `toolId` from whichever
  coordinator happened to be current, which after a swap is not the one holding
  the registration.
  
  Each of the six now tracks the coordinator and id it actually registered
  against, unregisters from that one before re-registering when either changes,
  and unregisters from it on destroy. The bookkeeping moved from `$state` to plain
  `let`, because a reactive write inside a tracked effect body is what AGENTS.md's
  Svelte Subscription Safety section rules out; the effect is now idempotent and
  compares stable identities rather than relying on a one-shot flag.
  
  `pie-tool-answer-eliminator` already re-registered correctly and is unchanged in
  behaviour. Its bookkeeping moves to plain `let` for the same reason, so all
  seven tools now carry one pattern.
  
  No public surface changes. A host that never republishes the runtime context
  sees exactly what it saw before.

## 0.3.67

### Patch Changes

- 73d2be4: Dim an eliminated choice on both strike paths, not only the fallback one.

  The dim was declared twice, and neither copy reached the path most learners are
  on. `components.css` carried it on `.pie-answer-eliminator-eliminated-fallback`, a
  class the strategy adds only when `CSS.highlights` is missing. The strategy's own
  injected rule carried it inside `::highlight(...)`, where a highlight pseudo
  honours only colour, background, text-decoration and text-shadow — so the
  declaration parsed and painted nothing. Every browser with the CSS Custom
  Highlight API shipped the strike as the sole cue for elimination.

  The dim now hangs off `[data-pie-answer-eliminated="true"]`, which both paths set
  on the choice container, and the inert declaration is gone from the injected rule.
  Redundant coding is the point: elimination has to survive a strike colour a
  learner cannot distinguish from the text.

## 0.3.65

### Patch Changes

- c16c77c: Mark eliminated answer choices that are not made of text: an X over images, and a
  line-through over rendered math, both in the same strike colour as the text.

  The strikethrough strategy paints with the CSS Custom Highlight API, which — like
  `text-decoration` — only draws on text. An answer choice whose content is a
  picture therefore looked completely untouched after being eliminated: the student
  got a pressed toggle button and nothing else.

  Images are replaced elements, so they cannot carry a pseudo-element either. Each
  `img` in an eliminated choice is now wrapped in a positioned
  `span.pie-answer-eliminator-image-strike` that hosts an absolutely-positioned SVG
  overlay drawing two diagonals corner to corner — upper-left to lower-right and
  lower-left to upper-right — for a big X over the whole image. Wrapping (rather
  than measuring and re-positioning an overlay) keeps the X glued to the image
  through later reflow: responsive resizing, a late image `load`, zoom.

  The wrapper preserves the image's own box: a fluid image that already spans its
  parent gets a block wrapper, a block-level image gets a `fit-content` block
  wrapper so it stays on its own line at its own width, and the wrapper's line box
  is collapsed so no descender gap lets the X overhang the artwork. Restoring the
  choice unwraps the image and returns the DOM to its original shape.

  The overlay is `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events: none` — the eliminated state is
  already announced on the label — and each diagonal is painted over a wider light
  casing line (`--pie-answer-eliminator-image-strike-casing-color`) so the X clears
  3:1 (SC 1.4.11) over dark artwork.

  ## Rendered math

  Math had the same problem for a different reason. MathJax's CHTML output draws
  every visible glyph as an `mjx-c` element with empty `textContent` — the character
  comes from `::before` generated content, which belongs to no Range — and its SVG
  output has no text at all. The highlight was painting only MathJax's
  `mjx-assistive-mml` copy of the source MathML, which is clipped to 1px, so a
  math-only choice looked identical to an un-eliminated one.

  For each `mjx-container` in an eliminated choice, the inner `mjx-math` box is now
  marked with `pie-answer-eliminator-math-strike` and painted by the theme. The
  rendered math box is an ordinary element, so this needs only a class and a
  pseudo-element — no wrapper, and MathJax's own layout is untouched.

  Which mark depends on the shape of the expression. A single row of symbols takes
  the centred line-through the prose takes. An expression that draws horizontal
  rules of its own — a fraction bar, a table rule — takes the diagonals an
  eliminated image takes, because a centred line lands on the math axis, exactly
  where the fraction bar already sits, and reads as a recoloured bar rather than an
  elimination. The split is structural (`mjx-mfrac`, `mjx-mtable`) rather than
  height-based: an inline `a/b` is only 1.16x its font size, indistinguishable in
  height from a radical (1.17x) or a parenthesised row (1.10x), yet it is precisely
  the colliding case. Radicals and stacked limits keep the line — their bars sit at
  the top, or the strike simply crosses the base.

  The paint target is the inner `mjx-math`, not the container: for inline math
  `mjx-container` is `display: inline`, so its rect is the surrounding line box — a
  constant ~1.16x font size whatever it holds — while the expression overflows it,
  a fraction by 3px above and 8px below. Painting the container both mismeasured
  the expression and drew the line in the wrong place.

  Only MathJax containers are marked. Natively rendered MathML keeps real text in
  `mi`/`mn`/`mo`, so the highlight already strikes every token there, and marking it
  too would double the line over one expression.

  ## One strike colour

  Text, images, and math all read `--pie-answer-eliminator-strike-color` (defaulting
  to `--pie-incorrect`), so a choice mixing prose, pictures, and math reads as a
  single treatment rather than three, and a host can restyle every part of an
  elimination from one property.
