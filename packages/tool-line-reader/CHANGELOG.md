### Patch Changes

- 599c657: Position frameless tool overlays against the content they are placed on.
  
  A frameless overlay was appended next to the toolbar buttons, so whichever
  element happened to be positioned became its containing block. At `passage` and
  `item` placement that is `pie-item-toolbar`, a header-sized box, and the line
  reader's opening position — derived from the viewport — put the panel outside
  the card. Auto-focus then scrolled the pane across to reveal it, taking the
  passage off screen. At `section` placement no positioned ancestor exists, so the
  same coordinates resolved against the initial containing block and looked right.
  
  `ToolRenderElement` gains `container`. A registration declaring
  `container: 'content-boundary'` has its element appended to the nearest
  `data-pie-tool-overlay-boundary` element — the box a host already marks as the
  content a tool belongs to — and the section player's item and passage cards make
  themselves the containing block for what lands there. The composition layer sets
  it for frameless overlays, so the toolbar honours a declaration rather than
  inferring intent from a tool's surface. A host declaring no boundary keeps the
  previous in-toolbar mount, so section-level placement is unchanged.
  
  The line reader derives its opening position from that containing block instead
  of the viewport, centring on the part of it currently on screen — the midpoint
  of a card several screens tall is not visible. Position and width are clamped to
  the containing block on open, on drag, on keyboard movement, on resize and on
  window resize, and it focuses with `preventScroll` so revealing it cannot scroll
  an ancestor pane.
  
  Ruler and protractor position by percentage, so they now self-centre in the card
  they are placed on rather than in whatever box was positioned above it.
- f10fa7d: Fix keyboard placement of the ruler and the protractor.
  
  Both tools read their current offset by parsing `style.transform` and fell back
  to `window.innerWidth / 2` and `window.innerHeight / 2` when there was none.
  Before the first drag there is none, so the first arrow key wrote roughly half
  the viewport as if it were a 10px nudge, and the tool jumped to the middle of the
  screen. The write then put `translate(-50%, -50%)` back into the inline
  transform, which `DOMMatrix` refuses to parse — values must be resolvable at
  parse time — so every press after that threw and keyboard placement stopped
  working altogether.
  
  The offset now comes from the computed transform, which is always a resolved
  matrix, with the centring's half-box added back to recover the offset the tool
  has actually been moved by. That reads correctly at rest and after a pointer
  drag, so a nudge continues from wherever the tool is.
  
  Keyboard movement is also clamped to the box the tool is positioned against.
  Moveable bounds a pointer drag, but a keyboard move writes `style.transform`
  directly and was bounded by nothing. `clampOffsetWithinBlock` and
  `resolveContainingBlockRect` in `@pie-players/pie-players-shared` are that
  clamp, shared rather than written twice.
  
  The line reader adopts the same helpers. It arrived at the same containing-block
  resolution independently and clamps an absolute centre point where the
  measurement tools clamp a translate offset; `clampPointWithinBlock` is that
  clamp in point coordinates, conjugate to the offset one by a translation of half
  the block. Behaviour is unchanged.

## 0.3.68

### Patch Changes

- 00b8a71: Localize player and tool chrome, with Dutch as the first complete locale.
  
  A host sets one attribute — `locale="nl-NL"` on `pie-item-player` or a
  section-player layout element, or `runtime.locale`, which wins — and every string
  the suite renders itself follows it: toolbar labels, tool panels, player status
  and error text, formative controls, live-region announcements, `aria-label`s.
  Unset, the rendered output is byte-identical to before, including every tool
  button's accessible name. The graceful default is `en-US` and never
  `navigator.language`: under fixed lockstep patch-only versioning a
  rendered-string change reaches live delivery on a host's next install with no
  build signal on their side, so a host that opts into nothing must keep exactly
  the chrome it has.
  
  Interface locale is the deployment's fact and no element can know it, so it travels
  as a composition context rather than through `model`: the toolkit publishes the
  resolved locale and one provider on its runtime context, and every capability
  resolves both through `connectToolRuntimeContext`. The change signal is the
  context's own republish, which matters because a catalog is a dynamic import —
  without a reactive read every label would pin the English that rendered a tick
  earlier, the same silent failure `composition-context.md` records twice. A
  component that finds no publisher falls back to an English-only default provider
  rather than rendering raw message keys, which is what keeps tools working in
  `print-player`, in Studio preview and in a bare harness.
  
  Content language is untouched and remains a separate concern on a separate
  channel. QTI 3's implementation guide states the independence directly: a
  candidate may choose an interface language which may or may not also be the
  language of the content. Conflating the two is why classic PIE renders Spanish
  widget chrome for a Spanish item.
  
  `@pie-players/pie-players-shared/i18n` is rebuilt around that. Catalogs are
  TypeScript modules keyed by full BCP-47 tag, replacing JSON keyed by bare
  language: the English catalog's shape now generates the `MessageKey` union, so a
  mistyped key is a compile error instead of a key rendered on screen — a key
  assembled at runtime has to be asserted through `dynamicMessageKey()`, which is
  greppable and pairs with `hasKey()` so a miss falls back to a literal — and `tsc`
  compiling a `.ts` catalog removes the `with { type: "json" }` import-attribute
  hazard that already broke every non-English locale once under Node's ESM loader.
  Requests resolve through RFC 4647 lookup and then primary-subtag widening, so
  POSIX `nl_NL`, bare `nl` and regional `nl-BE` all reach the `nl-NL` catalog;
  `SimpleI18n` gains `plural()` — `Intl.PluralRules` alone, so Arabic's
  `zero`/`two`/`few`/`many` and Polish's `few`/`many` are reachable — plus
  `withLocale()` for two players rendering different locales from one provider, and
  it no longer writes `lang`/`dir` to `document.documentElement`, which an embedded
  player has no business doing. Components stamp their own host instead.
  
  The module split is what keeps this off the wire. `i18n/types` is type-only and
  erases; `i18n/provider` carries the 5 KB English catalog; the dynamic loader map
  lives in `i18n/catalogs`, which players import and tools do not. Since every
  player and tool `vite.config.ts` sets `external: []`, that boundary is the
  difference between one locale chunk and eighteen tool bundles each carrying a
  catalog they will never load.
  
  `ToolRegistration` gains optional `nameKey` and `descriptionKey` beside the
  still-required `name` and `description`. The keys are supplied by
  `default-tool-loaders`, which owns the packaged capability set, and a
  host-authored registration with no keys renders its `name` verbatim.
  
  The English catalog does enumerate a `tools.<capability>` namespace per packaged
  capability, so `default-tool-loaders` is not the only file naming them.
  `check:capability-neutrality` is unaffected: what it protects is core not
  branching on a capability id or granting behaviour from one, and a message key
  does neither — it is inert text, resolved by whoever holds the id. Splitting the
  catalog per capability would satisfy the letter of it and cost both the
  single-reference coverage check and the bundle boundary that keeps locale strings
  out of eighteen tool bundles.
  
  English output is byte-identical. Every English catalog value reproduces the
  literal it replaced exactly, punctuation and inconsistencies included, because
  fixed lockstep patch-only versioning puts a reworded string into a host's live
  delivery on their next install with no signal on their side — and most of what
  this change touches is accessible names and live-region announcements, where a
  host may be asserting exact text. Where the pre-adoption code rendered the same
  concept in two forms, the catalog carries both rather than assembling one by
  interpolation: `tools.ruler` has three forms of each unit name, matching the Title
  Case button label, the lowercase announcement and the raw state token in the
  accessible name. Improving any of these strings is a separate change with its own
  entry.
  
  `en-US` and `nl-NL` are complete at 402 keys, and they are the only locales
  shipped. The pre-adoption `es`/`zh`/`ar` catalogs are deleted rather than
  re-keyed: 76 of their 142 keys named UI this codebase does not render — a
  section-builder, an assessment shell, 25 Desmos internals Desmos localizes
  itself, colour-scheme names the theme registry owns — while the strings actually
  on screen had no keys at all; the published `dist` omitted
  `with { type: "json" }` on exactly the three dynamic locale imports, so none of
  them could load outside a bundler in any version through `0.3.67`; and nothing
  read them, here or in any consumer checkout. Machine-filling the gap would ship
  strings nobody has read, to learners.
  
  `check:i18n-coverage` now runs in the pre-commit and CI gates: a locale declared
  complete must stay at 100%, a locale mid-translation can be listed as carried and
  is reported without gating, and either fails on a key English no longer defines.
  
  The pre-adoption i18n layer is replaced rather than versioned alongside.
  `BUNDLED_TRANSLATIONS`, `loadTranslations`, `SimpleI18n.tn()` and two Svelte
  composables are gone. A grep of all three consumer checkouts finds no call site
  for any of them outside build caches — the layer was published complete and
  unused, which is what made replacement the right move instead of a second
  parallel implementation of the kind that produced `I18nService` as a copy of
  `SimpleI18n`.
- 54742db: A second full-codebase review turned up more drift, duplication, and interface
  problems than the first sweep caught, concentrated in the TTS provider stack and
  the debugger-tool family. No public surface changes; behaviour fixes are called
  out explicitly.
  
  **TTS rate and pitch.** Polly and Google both advertised `supportsRate` /
  `supportsPitch` while never reading `request.rate` / `request.pitch` — a caller
  asking for a different speech rate got normal-speed audio with no error.
  `BaseTTSProvider.applyProsody` / `buildProsodyAttrs` now wrap plain-text requests
  in an SSML `<prosody>` envelope on both providers; already-SSML input is left
  alone. `pitch` follows this repo's existing 0-2 multiplier convention (the TTS
  settings UI's `normalizePitch`), converted to SSML's relative percentage form.
  
  **SchoolCity speech-mark timing.** `tts-client-server`'s custom-transport parser
  reimplemented SchoolCity's JSONL wire format from scratch, with none of the
  offset/time-unit corrections `SchoolCityServerProvider` applies — reproducing the
  mistiming bug that correction was built to fix. `normalizeSpeechMarks` moves to
  `tts-server-core` so both share one implementation.
  
  **TTS error-mapping granularity.** Polly collapsed every AWS SDK error to
  `PROVIDER_ERROR`; SchoolCity did the same for every HTTP failure. Both now map
  to `TEXT_TOO_LONG` / `INVALID_REQUEST` / `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` /
  `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` where the underlying exception name or HTTP status
  says so, matching the granularity Google already had. A documented consumer maps
  these four `TTSErrorCode` members onto HTTP responses, so Polly's
  `TextLengthExceededException` reaching `TEXT_TOO_LONG` is newly correct handling
  on a path that previously always fell through to a generic error.
  
  **Rate-to-speedRate bucketing.** `SchoolCityServerProvider` and
  `ServerTTSProvider` each bucketed a numeric rate into `slow`/`medium`/`fast`
  with different thresholds, disagreeing for rate 1.1-1.49.
  `resolveSpeedRateBucket` in `tts-server-core` is now the one implementation,
  on the server's deliberate 0.95-1.5 tolerance band.
  
  **Shadow-DOM-blind theme lookup.** `tool-color-scheme`'s host lookup called
  `closest('pie-theme')` from inside its own open shadow root, which
  `Element.closest()` can never cross — on any page with more than one
  independently-scoped `<pie-theme>` it silently always picked the wrong one.
  `resolvePieThemeHost` in `pie-theme` walks out through each shadow root's host
  to find the real ancestor. The same change adds `applyPieColorScheme` as the one
  canonical "resolve host, set scheme, persist" sequence, replacing both
  `tool-color-scheme`'s own copy and `apps/section-demos`' independently-drifted
  version.
  
  **Debugger-panel subscription lifecycle.** `EventPanel` and `SectionSessionPanel`
  each reimplemented the same subscribe/detach/resubscribe scaffolding;
  `SectionSessionPanel`'s read and wrote reactive state directly inside a tracked
  `$effect` body instead of wrapping it in `untrack()`, and its lifecycle handler
  always resubscribed instead of distinguishing the disposed and same-target cases
  `EventPanel` already handled. `createSectionControllerSubscriptionManager` in
  `section-player-tools-shared` is now shared by both. The same change wires
  `persistence-scope` / `persistence-panel-id` through for `PnpPanel` and
  `SectionSessionPanel`, which had neither despite `SharedFloatingPanel` supporting
  layout persistence and two sibling debuggers already exposing it.
  
  **Pointer-drag tracking.** `tool-line-reader` and `tool-text-to-speech` each
  hand-rolled identical pointer-capture drag-position tracking.
  `createPointerDragController` in `players-shared/ui` covers the shared position
  math; `tool-line-reader`'s separate resize handling stays where it is.
  
  **Custom-element registration.** `pie-print` bypassed its own package's guarded
  registry and called Lit's `@customElement` decorator directly, which throws an
  uncaught `NotSupportedError` on double-bundling where every other player
  no-ops. It now goes through the same guard. `defineCustomElementSafely`
  (players-shared) and print-player's registry also shared the same
  duplicate-define handling with different collision coverage; consolidated into
  one implementation, which incidentally fixes a latent bug where an
  already-registered tag not tracked locally hit a doomed wrapped-subclass retry
  instead of short-circuiting.
  
  **Everything else.** `coerceBooleanLike` had three different, disagreeing
  implementations across `section-player` and `assessment-player` for the same
  attribute-coercion job; unified in `players-shared`. `sanitize-item-markup` and
  `sanitize-svg-icon`'s DOMPurify forbid-lists had drifted despite a comment
  claiming parity; now share one list. `AssessmentPlayerDefaultElement` swallowed
  TTS teardown errors in empty catch blocks instead of reporting them through
  `ToolkitCoordinator.reportFrameworkError`. `item-player`'s `"player-error"` event
  now has an exported constant matching the pattern `section-player` and
  `assessment-player` already use (no wire-value change).
- 27284f8: Re-register a tool with the coordinator when the coordinator instance changes,
  so stacking and visibility keep working after a runtime-context republish.
  
  Six tools registered once and never again. The guard was a `$state` boolean
  flipped inside a tracked `$effect` — `if (coordinator && toolId && !registered)`
  — so the first coordinator to arrive won permanently. The coordinator does not
  arrive once: it is read from the runtime context (a prop, for text-to-speech),
  and a republish hands over a new instance. After one, the tool's z-index layer,
  `bringToFront` and visibility-restore were all still pointing at a coordinator
  nobody consults, and the new one had never heard of the tool — so a ruler would
  not raise above a protractor, and a tool hidden and reshown lost its position.
  Teardown had the mirror fault: it unregistered `toolId` from whichever
  coordinator happened to be current, which after a swap is not the one holding
  the registration.
  
  Each of the six now tracks the coordinator and id it actually registered
  against, unregisters from that one before re-registering when either changes,
  and unregisters from it on destroy. The bookkeeping moved from `$state` to plain
  `let`, because a reactive write inside a tracked effect body is what AGENTS.md's
  Svelte Subscription Safety section rules out; the effect is now idempotent and
  compares stable identities rather than relying on a one-shot flag.
  
  `pie-tool-answer-eliminator` already re-registered correctly and is unchanged in
  behaviour. Its bookkeeping moves to plain `let` for the same reason, so all
  seven tools now carry one pattern.
  
  No public surface changes. A host that never republishes the runtime context
  sees exactly what it saw before.

## 0.3.64

### Patch Changes

- dc44392: Make the frame's masking a host setting rather than a student one. How much surrounding context a test taker can still see trades against reading focus, which is a decision a programme makes for its whole population, so `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-opacity` is now the only way to change it: the keyboard-only `[`/`]` adjustment — undiscoverable to anyone not reading the tool's aria-label, and with no pointer equivalent — is gone, and the component no longer writes the opacity inline, so a host declaration wins without `!important`.

  Promote the frame's masking properties to registered host contract. `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-opacity`, `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-color`, and `--pie-tool-line-reader-control-color` are now `component-public` entries in `packages/theme/src/token-registry.json` instead of package-private internals, since a deployment is expected to configure them and needs the compatibility guarantee that carries. The control colour is registered as the fill's companion: the glyphs sit on the frame and default to white for a dark scrim, so a light fill has to set it too and keep 3:1 against the fill. `--pie-tool-line-reader-outline-color` stays package-private.

## 0.3.63

### Patch Changes

- b960bae: Replace the line reader highlight/obscure modes with a single window view: a fully transparent pane that leaves underlying page content visible, surrounded on all four edges by an obscuring frame (black at 80% opacity by default, themeable via `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-color` and `--pie-tool-line-reader-frame-opacity`), with 4px rounded corners and a subtle drop shadow. Drag and `+`/`-` now resize the reading window, `[`/`]` adjust frame opacity, and the color cycling (`C`) and mode toggle (`M`) shortcuts are removed. Also fixes the resize handle hit test, which matched a class name the markup never rendered.

  Add frame controls: a close button that hides the tool through the coordinator (also reachable with `Escape`), a reading-window resize handle, and a frame resize handle that adjusts the frame band height and the overall width. All three are real focusable buttons that meet the 24x24 minimum target size, and each drag has an arrow-key equivalent on the focused handle.

  Keep the window readable in every PIE colour scheme: the frame stays a dark scrim rather than following `--pie-text` (an ink-coloured scrim cannot mask its own scheme's text, and a light one glares in a dark scheme), and an ink hairline plus an ink-derived shadow supply the window boundary that a dark scrim on a dark page cannot show on its own. New `--pie-tool-line-reader-outline-color` hook.

  Draw the frame as one element's border box instead of four abutting boxes. Four translucent boxes each antialias their shared edge, so whenever layout landed off whole pixels (page zoom, fractional font scale) the junctions rendered at partial coverage and showed as light seams between the side edges and the top/bottom bands.

  Fix the keyboard move shortcuts going dead after a click: pressing the frame calls `preventDefault` to start a drag, which also suppressed the press's default focus, so the tool never became the focus target and arrow keys went to the page instead. Both the frame and the resize handles now claim focus explicitly (with `preventScroll`).
