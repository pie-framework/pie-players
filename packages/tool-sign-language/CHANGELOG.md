### Patch Changes

- 5e6fcde: Make accessibility catalog ownership one resolver contract.

  Mounted items and passages now register all entity-root, extracted, and model
  catalogs through one owner transaction. Content surfaces observe a bound owner
  view and give capabilities an immutable, deterministic catalog snapshot instead
  of exposing the raw entity, resolver, and separately assembled owner context.
  Signing and transcript capabilities now own only their card interpretation.

  Capability authors should read `ToolContentDependencyContext.catalogs` and no
  longer use the removed catalog-collection exports. Direct resolver clients,
  including inline TTS, retain `getAlternative(...)` and
  `catalogOwnerContextFor(...)`. Existing catalog IDs, card and payload shapes,
  `data-catalog-idref`, scoped lookup precedence, TTS fallback behavior, and
  section-player custom-element contracts are unchanged. Invalid optional catalog
  data remains recoverable: it is warned about and omitted without blocking the
  primary assessment content.

## 0.3.65

### Patch Changes

- 2b015a9: Render docked alternates on the passage card, not only the item card.

  A catalog card docks to a content node, and a passage owns content nodes exactly
  as an item does — so a signed reading of a shared passage is authored once, on the
  passage, under the owner scope `<pie-passage-shell>` already registers. Resolution
  worked; nothing rendered it, because the media region existed only on the item
  card.

  The region moves to `SectionCardMediaSplit`, shared by both cards, so there is one
  implementation of grant-plus-content availability, mount reconciliation and split
  sizing rather than a copy per card kind. The host surface is renamed
  `item-media` → `content-media`, since item cards and passage cards open the same
  slot and a capability should declare it once: `@pie-players/pie-tool-sign-language`
  now exports `CONTENT_MEDIA_SURFACE` in place of `ITEM_MEDIA_SURFACE` and declares
  `supportedLevels: ["item", "passage"]`. A host capability that declared
  `surfaces: ["item-media"]` must declare `"content-media"` to keep mounting.

- 3f6e33a: Signing becomes a capability package. New `@pie-players/pie-tool-sign-language`, and no package in the player names signing any more.

  The last capability-specific code in the generic core was signing's: the toolkit validated `sign-language` catalog cards, and section-player's item card knew the `signLanguage` support id, the catalog type, the language-matching rule and the region element by name. So the one accommodation PIE most needs hosts to be able to add was the one thing only we could add.

  ## The new package

  `@pie-players/pie-tool-sign-language` owns `signLanguageRegistration` (`activation: "region"`, `surfaces: ["item-media"]`, `supportedLevels: ["item"]`, `requiresAuthoredContent`), the card validators and language matching that were `services/sign-language-cards.ts` in the toolkit, the content resolver that was the signing half of section-player's `section-item-media.ts`, and `<pie-tool-sign-language>`, which was `SectionItemMediaRegion.svelte`.

  It is authored against `@pie-players/pie-assessment-toolkit/tools/internal` — the same entry point our packaged registrations use — and it is the worked example of a capability contributed from outside the player. A host opts in with two lines:

  ```ts
  import { signLanguageRegistration } from "@pie-players/pie-tool-sign-language";
  registry.register(signLanguageRegistration);
  ```

  Importing the package registers the element, so there is no module-loader entry to add.

  **Deliberately not in `createPackagedToolRegistry` or `DEFAULT_TOOL_MODULE_LOADERS.`** An accommodation with an authored-content dependency is a deployment's decision: a default that granted it would hand signing to every learner whose item happened to carry a card. The `apps/section-demos` `sign-language` route now registers it itself, which is the demonstration that a host can contribute a capability with no id of ours involved.

  ## What section-player kept and what it lost

  `SectionItemCard.svelte` iterates `getToolsBySurface("item-media")`, decides each capability against **its own** `pnpSupportIds`, calls its `requiresAuthoredContent.resolve`, and mounts through `ToolRegistry.renderForSurface`. It names no capability, no support id, no catalog type and no element tag, and it does not depend on the signing package — `check:player-tool-boundaries` forbids even the string.

  The region's own layout stays here, because it is the card's geometry rather than the capability's: `MEDIA_REGION_*`, `clampMediaRegionPercent`, `mediaRegionPercentFromDrag` and `SectionCardSplitDivider`. The three `--pie-section-player-item-media-*` tokens keep their names — hosts set them and PIE-880 is in testing against them — but the registry now records the signing package as their owner.

  Two behaviours the old file documented are preserved and re-keyed generically, because both were load-bearing: the `onCatalogsChange` re-resolve with a resolve-once-on-subscribe, and the write-only-when-the-signature-changed guard. That guard is not an optimisation. Re-rendering the card re-applies `item` on `<pie-item-shell>`, which re-registers the item's catalogs, which makes the resolver emit again; one unconditional write per emission makes the cycle self-sustaining and Svelte aborts at its depth limit with the DOM half-applied.

  ## Contract changes

  `isVisibleInContext` is now optional on `ToolRegistration`, required for the two toolbar activations and rejected only when present and not a function. A region capability has no toolbar presence to be relevant to, and the question it would answer — is there anything to show here — is `requiresAuthoredContent`. A registration that omits it is never returned by `getVisibleTools`. Callers that invoke it on a registration they wrap need `?.` — the one in-repo case was a demo decorator.

  `applyMediaFragment` reached the public surface through `sign-language-cards.js`; it is now exported from `services/catalog-media.js` directly, along with `isSafeMediaSrc`, `normalizeMediaSources`, `normalizeMediaFragment` and `trimmedOrUndefined` — the validators any capability package needs to read a media payload. The signing-specific exports (`SIGN_LANGUAGE_CATALOG_TYPE`, `AMERICAN_SIGN_LANGUAGE`, `describeSignLanguage`, `isSignLanguageCard`, `matchesRequestedSignLanguage`, `resolveSignLanguageMedia`, `SignLanguageMedia`) move to the new package.

  `packages/players-shared`'s `SignLanguageCardPayload` stays. It is authored wire data alongside `CatalogCard`, and a published shape for a standard support id is not a core dependency on a capability — the same argument that exempts `pnp-standard-features.ts`.

  ## Behaviour

  Unchanged, and that is the whole point. PIE-880 is in testing, so the guard is that its specs pass with import-path edits and **no assertion changes**: `section-player-sign-language-region.spec.ts` and `pie881-imported-asl-integration.spec.ts` (14 specs, including the re-registration-loop and keyboard-divider cases), plus the unit tests, now split between `sign-language-content.test.ts` in the new package and the sizing half left behind.

  `check:fixed-versioning` treated a 404 from npm as a failure, so adding any publishable package broke it. A never-published package is now reported and excluded from the version-sequence comparison; a network or auth failure still stops the gate, because "cannot tell" must not read as "fine".

- 3972f16: **Breaking for capability packages.** `ToolSurfaceRenderResult.sync` takes the current render context: `sync?: (context: ToolSurfaceRenderContext) => void`.

  It took no argument, so a registration had nothing to read but the context captured when it rendered. A host reconciles surface capabilities by `toolId` and calls `sync` rather than remounting — a `<video>` recreated mid-playback restarts the recording — so `sync` is the _only_ path a re-resolve has to an element already on screen, and with a captured context it re-applied the values the host already had. Two live consequences: a signed alternate re-resolved to a different recording (a `signLang` parameter change, or a catalog registering after first paint) left the learner watching the previous one, and a host calling `updateAssessment(...)` mid-session left the annotation gateway wired to the previous coordinator. Both were silent.

  Update a registration by reading the parameter instead of the closure:

  ```diff
  -const applyProps = () => {
  -  element.media = context.content;
  +const applyProps = (current: ToolSurfaceRenderContext) => {
  +  element.media = current.content;
   };
  -applyProps();
  +applyProps(context);
   return { element, sync: applyProps };
  ```

  ## Host surfaces a region capability can actually reach

  `section-overlay` gated every capability on `decideToolPolicy`, whose candidates are seeded only from `tools.placement` — and placing an `activation: "region"` capability is a `tools.unplaceableActivation` error at `error` severity. A capability that is only ever a region was therefore unreachable on that surface in both directions, and the mechanism worked for exactly the one capability that motivated it, which also has a toolbar activation. Region capabilities are now gated on `decideFeaturePolicy`, matching the item-media surface; placement-driven ones keep the placement question, which is where their candidacy comes from.

  `item-media` now awaits `ensureToolModuleLoaded` before mounting, so a capability registered through the documented lazy module-loader path renders instead of silently missing its element. This costs a capability that registers its element eagerly one microtask.

  `requiresAuthoredContent` is resolvable only on a surface the host renders per item or per passage. `CatalogOwnerContext` names an item model or a passage and never a section, because a DRD resource pairs with content rather than with a container — so `section-overlay` now declines a capability declaring one, with a console warning, instead of mounting it with `content: undefined`. That is documented on the contract; `resolve` must also be synchronous and return JSON-serializable content, both of which hosts already relied on and neither of which was stated.

  ## Item media region lifecycle

  Three fixes in `SectionItemCard`, all reachable by toggling an accommodation at runtime:

  - **Losing the last grant destroys the region, and the mount effect treated a missing anchor as "nothing to do."** The capability's `destroy()` never ran, so a detached `<video>` kept playing audio, and its entry stayed in the mounted map — so the next grant found an "existing" mount that was no longer in the document and the region stayed blank for the rest of the session. It now tears down, matching what the section-overlay surface already did.
  - **The region and its keyboard-focusable resize divider followed the grant count, not what mounted.** `renderSurface` returning `null` is a legitimate answer — a host that remapped the element tag through `toolTagMap` to one it never defined takes that path — which produced an empty 34% column with a handle dividing nothing. Both now follow the mounted count.
  - **Both surface anchors are `display: contents`.** They were always-present elements generating their own box: the overlay anchor as a permanent flex item shifting `gap` and child-index selectors, the media anchor breaking any `height: 100%` chain between the region and the capability's element.

  ## Guarantee that was asserted but not enforced

  `UNIVERSAL_SUPPORTS_PRESET`'s exclusion of content-dependent accommodations was a hardcoded `not.toContain("signLanguage")`, with a comment deferring the declaration-driven form to the step that has now landed. It reads `registry.getContentDependentSupportIds()`, which had no caller outside its own unit test, and a second assertion covers the other half: no packaged registration declares a content dependency, so a twelfth one could not pass by being invisible to the first check.

  ## PNP debugger

  Region capabilities no longer get per-level placement toggles or an "all available tools" entry. Clicking one wrote config that fails `tools.unplaceableActivation` at `error` severity, and the "visible" marker beside it read a placement-scoped decision a region capability is never in — so it reported "not visible" while the capability was correctly rendering. Rows show `host surface (not placed)` and, for a content-dependent capability, what has to be authored, which is what `contentDependencyDescription` was added for.
