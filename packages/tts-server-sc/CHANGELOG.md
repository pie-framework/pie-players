### Patch Changes

- 7708334: Report the SchoolCity TTS locale roster from `getVoices()`.
  
  It returned an empty array. The service serves 29 locales with one default Polly
  voice each, and `SynthesizeRequest.voice` was already plumbed through to it, so
  the missing piece was never selection — it was discovery. With no roster, those
  locales were reachable only by a caller that already knew a `lang_id` to
  hardcode, which is the substance of PIE-479.
  
  The roster is a table transcribed from the map the service reads
  (`sc-texttospeech-api` - `src/helpers/voices.js`), not a lookup. The service's
  whole surface is `GET /ping` and an authenticated `POST /`, so there is nothing
  to query; the trade is that the table goes stale silently if the service adds a
  locale, and in exchange every entry is traceable to one upstream line and
  `getVoices()` costs no request and needs no credential. Only the default voice
  per locale is listed — the service forwards any `VoiceId` Polly knows, and
  `voices.js` names alternates in trailing comments, but those are hand-maintained
  annotations rather than the map the service actually reads.
  
  `language` is a language range matched per RFC 4647 basic filtering, so `en`
  reaches every English locale and `en-GB` reaches `en-GB-WLS`. Gender is set only
  where the upstream map records it, which leaves `arb` and `cmn-CN` out of a
  gender-filtered query rather than asserting a fact their source does not carry.
  
  Also exported without a provider instance — `schoolCityVoices`,
  `SCHOOLCITY_DEFAULT_VOICES`, `defaultVoiceForSchoolCityLanguage` and
  `isSupportedSchoolCityLanguage`. That last one matters more than it looks: an
  unrecognized `lang_id` is not an upstream error, it is rewritten to `en-US`, so
  an unserved locale returns English audio and no failure. A caller that wants to
  know has to check locally.
  
  Purely additive. Nothing in the repository consumed this provider's `getVoices()`
  before, so no existing caller changes behavior.
- 54742db: A second full-codebase review turned up more drift, duplication, and interface
  problems than the first sweep caught, concentrated in the TTS provider stack and
  the debugger-tool family. No public surface changes; behaviour fixes are called
  out explicitly.
  
  **TTS rate and pitch.** Polly and Google both advertised `supportsRate` /
  `supportsPitch` while never reading `request.rate` / `request.pitch` — a caller
  asking for a different speech rate got normal-speed audio with no error.
  `BaseTTSProvider.applyProsody` / `buildProsodyAttrs` now wrap plain-text requests
  in an SSML `<prosody>` envelope on both providers; already-SSML input is left
  alone. `pitch` follows this repo's existing 0-2 multiplier convention (the TTS
  settings UI's `normalizePitch`), converted to SSML's relative percentage form.
  
  **SchoolCity speech-mark timing.** `tts-client-server`'s custom-transport parser
  reimplemented SchoolCity's JSONL wire format from scratch, with none of the
  offset/time-unit corrections `SchoolCityServerProvider` applies — reproducing the
  mistiming bug that correction was built to fix. `normalizeSpeechMarks` moves to
  `tts-server-core` so both share one implementation.
  
  **TTS error-mapping granularity.** Polly collapsed every AWS SDK error to
  `PROVIDER_ERROR`; SchoolCity did the same for every HTTP failure. Both now map
  to `TEXT_TOO_LONG` / `INVALID_REQUEST` / `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` /
  `AUTHENTICATION_ERROR` where the underlying exception name or HTTP status
  says so, matching the granularity Google already had. A documented consumer maps
  these four `TTSErrorCode` members onto HTTP responses, so Polly's
  `TextLengthExceededException` reaching `TEXT_TOO_LONG` is newly correct handling
  on a path that previously always fell through to a generic error.
  
  **Rate-to-speedRate bucketing.** `SchoolCityServerProvider` and
  `ServerTTSProvider` each bucketed a numeric rate into `slow`/`medium`/`fast`
  with different thresholds, disagreeing for rate 1.1-1.49.
  `resolveSpeedRateBucket` in `tts-server-core` is now the one implementation,
  on the server's deliberate 0.95-1.5 tolerance band.
  
  **Shadow-DOM-blind theme lookup.** `tool-color-scheme`'s host lookup called
  `closest('pie-theme')` from inside its own open shadow root, which
  `Element.closest()` can never cross — on any page with more than one
  independently-scoped `<pie-theme>` it silently always picked the wrong one.
  `resolvePieThemeHost` in `pie-theme` walks out through each shadow root's host
  to find the real ancestor. The same change adds `applyPieColorScheme` as the one
  canonical "resolve host, set scheme, persist" sequence, replacing both
  `tool-color-scheme`'s own copy and `apps/section-demos`' independently-drifted
  version.
  
  **Debugger-panel subscription lifecycle.** `EventPanel` and `SectionSessionPanel`
  each reimplemented the same subscribe/detach/resubscribe scaffolding;
  `SectionSessionPanel`'s read and wrote reactive state directly inside a tracked
  `$effect` body instead of wrapping it in `untrack()`, and its lifecycle handler
  always resubscribed instead of distinguishing the disposed and same-target cases
  `EventPanel` already handled. `createSectionControllerSubscriptionManager` in
  `section-player-tools-shared` is now shared by both. The same change wires
  `persistence-scope` / `persistence-panel-id` through for `PnpPanel` and
  `SectionSessionPanel`, which had neither despite `SharedFloatingPanel` supporting
  layout persistence and two sibling debuggers already exposing it.
  
  **Pointer-drag tracking.** `tool-line-reader` and `tool-text-to-speech` each
  hand-rolled identical pointer-capture drag-position tracking.
  `createPointerDragController` in `players-shared/ui` covers the shared position
  math; `tool-line-reader`'s separate resize handling stays where it is.
  
  **Custom-element registration.** `pie-print` bypassed its own package's guarded
  registry and called Lit's `@customElement` decorator directly, which throws an
  uncaught `NotSupportedError` on double-bundling where every other player
  no-ops. It now goes through the same guard. `defineCustomElementSafely`
  (players-shared) and print-player's registry also shared the same
  duplicate-define handling with different collision coverage; consolidated into
  one implementation, which incidentally fixes a latent bug where an
  already-registered tag not tracked locally hit a doomed wrapped-subclass retry
  instead of short-circuiting.
  
  **Everything else.** `coerceBooleanLike` had three different, disagreeing
  implementations across `section-player` and `assessment-player` for the same
  attribute-coercion job; unified in `players-shared`. `sanitize-item-markup` and
  `sanitize-svg-icon`'s DOMPurify forbid-lists had drifted despite a comment
  claiming parity; now share one list. `AssessmentPlayerDefaultElement` swallowed
  TTS teardown errors in empty catch blocks instead of reporting them through
  `ToolkitCoordinator.reportFrameworkError`. `item-player`'s `"player-error"` event
  now has an exported constant matching the pattern `section-player` and
  `assessment-player` already use (no wire-value change).
